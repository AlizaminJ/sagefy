          Classical Guitar, <em>you can set your own goal</em>. We'll help you

          you want to achieve.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pick a <strong>time goal</strong>. Want to do 3 tasks per week? Finish
          it by April 10th? We'll help you meet your goal by letting you
          <strong>track</strong> against it. We'll also send you

        <ul>

            <strong>Quizlet flashcards</strong>? Great, you can add them right
            to your list!
          </li>

            Found a <strong>book</strong>, physical, iBook, or PDF? We'll break
            it down by chapter for you. And we’ll add some flashcards, quizzes,
            and other activities between chapters.
          </li>

        <p>
          As you add resources, we'll <strong>suggest</strong> more items to
          help you learn. It could be extra coding practices, a multiple-choice
          question quiz to check your understanding, or a miniature project.
          We'll suggest resources to make sure you get the information and
          practice you need.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Don't have the time to make your own plan?</em> No worries! We’ll
          start you off with an existing highly-rated plan
