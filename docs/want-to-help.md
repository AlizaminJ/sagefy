## Content

- Building any content of your choosing.
  - This is by far the most important item on the list!
  - [Read this doc](http://docs.sagefy.org/how-to-build-a-course-in-sagefy) and reach out! More than happy to help organize and get content into the system.
  - We've very interested in topics outside of mathematics, computer science, and foreign languages (though those are good too)! Arts, history, natural sciences, social sciences, and more are all welcome!
- Helping us to mass pull content from a high-quality content source.
  - Researching different options available.
  - Working with sources on copyright issues and technical porting.
- Supporting the existing electronic music content with:
  - Feedback on the current content.
  - Additional interactive examples in JavaScript
  - Additional content on the artistic study of electronic music, history, tools, and projects.

  - Improving current Bayesian Knowledge Tracing models, particularly with parameter estimation
  - Designing an implementing contributor rating system
  - Improving the card choosing mathematics
  - Handling 'asynchronous scoring' (such as peer-scored cards)
  - Recommending subjects to learners
  - Models for social learning

## Financial and Legal
