title: What is Sagefy?
---

**Learn anything, customized for you.** _And always free._

_Sagefy is an open-content adaptive learning platform._

**Adaptive Learning.** Get the most out of your time and effort spent. Sagefy optimizes based on what you already know and what your goal is.

**Open-Content.** Anyone can view, share, create, and edit content. Open-content means that Sagefy reaches a range of learning subjects.

Sagefy uses learning science research in its [Data Structure](Data-Structure) and [Ideas](Ideas).
