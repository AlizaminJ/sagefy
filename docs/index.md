**Learn anything, customized for you.** _And always free._

Sagefy is an _open-content, adaptive learning_ platform.

* **Adaptive Learning.** Sagefy optimizes based on what you already know and what your goal is. Get the most out of your time and effort spent.
* **Open-Content.** Anyone can view, share, create, and edit content. Because anyone can contribute, you can learn anything you want.
