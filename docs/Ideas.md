The ideas are the foundation of Sagefy's architecture. The ideas are broad and based on highly common patterns in memory and learning research. Use the ideas to provide a sense of direction.

1. Do One Thing at a Time
2. Set & Adhere to Goals
3. Adapt to Prior Knowledge
4. Build the Graph
5. Empower Choice
6. Dive Deep
7. Make It Real
8. Learn Together

## 1) Do One Thing at a Time

Our memory system is powerful but limited. We are most effective when focusing on one task at a time.

### What do we mean by "Do One Thing at a Time"?

* Only do one specific activity at any given point in time.
* Avoid multitasking.
* Prefer one source of input and one source of output at a time.
* Scaffold the learner to success.
* Avoid extraneous choices.
* Stay focused and eliminate tangents.
* Account for memory limits -- chunking, pretraining, and modality.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

* The user can only be presented one card at a time.
* The user only works on one unit at a time.
* When the learner must make a choice about which subject or unit to pursue, the learner is only presented with the choice.
* A contributor can only change one entity at a time.

## 2. Set & Adhere to Goals

Defining small, achievable goals and constantly checking against them builds better, more focused content.

### What do we mean by "Set & Adhere to Goals"?

* Always define the goal.
* Focus content on exploring the different facets of the goal.
* Remove content that is not needed for the goal.
* Eliminate distractions.
* Define both knowledge and skills.
* Keep the learner aware of their progress.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

* Units are defined by their goal, or objective.
* Cards must be attached to a unit.
* Subjects can be small or large, but they always have a single description.
* Flagging enables users to remove irrelevant content.

## 3. Adapt to Prior Knowledge

The strongest predictor of how much we will learn is what we already know. Every learning experience must be adapted to the learner's prior knowledge.

### What do we mean by "Adapt to Prior Knowledge"?

* Adjust the challenge level to the learner's knowledge.
* Ensure a learner knows what they need to in order to complete a task.
* Focus on areas of weakness.
* Focus on building knowledge.
* Connect new information with prior knowledge.
* Scaffold the learner to success.
* Use assessment to optimize learning.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

* Cards and units have requires, which ensures the learner has sufficient prior knowledge.
* The algorithms which sequence show cards, units, and subjects that are available to the learner.
  * The algorithms which sequence the entities focus on improving the learner's prior knowledge.
  * A diagnostic assessment means learners can build prior knowledge where lacking.
  * A learner with high prior knowledge can skip to more relevant areas.

## 4. Build the Graph

Our memory system works by forming relationships. Mastery is the result of an organized thought process. Students link new information with information that they already know.

### What do we mean by "Build the Graph"?

* Show how information is organized directly to the learner.
* Relate information to prior information.
* Task the learner with organizational challenges.
* Use technology to automate organization.
* Keep the learner aware of their progress.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

* The three basic entities are easy to remember and have a clear hierarchy.
* Subjects can embed each other, allowing for a variety of organizational structures.
* A card must belong to a unit, which defines its purpose.
* A unit can only have a single goal, limiting extraneous information.
* Requires are available for cards and units, allowing for the system to automatically keep things organized with low effort.
* Contributors do not organize courses, but simply describe relationships. The algorithms handle keeping things organized to the learner.

## 5. Empower Choice

### What do we mean by "Empower Choice"?

* Autonomy is an intrinsic motivator. Choice fuels autonomy.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

## 6. Dive Deep

Route memorizing isn't enough. We must be able to use our knowledge.

### What do we mean by "Dive Deep"?

* Practice!
* Go beyond route memorization. Challenge the learner to explain, analyse, apply, and synthesize.
* Build metacognitive capabilities.
* Go in for the long term. Use spaced repetition.
* Focus on developing areas of weakness.
* Remove barriers to going deep.
* Effective, timely feedback.
* Seek mastery. Learn components, integration, and application.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

* Subjects can contain subjects and units. Subjects can scale out extensively.
* Cards are flexible in format. This flexibility means we can ask for more than comprehesion.
* By removing complexity in the data structure, we make room for more depth by adding flexibility.
* The system encourages spaced repetition to ensure maximum retention of knowledge.

## 7. Make it Real

We rely on real-life experiences to guide to our learning.

### What do we mean by "Make it Real"?

* Connect material with real life problems.
* Use images and videos to connect with the visual processing center.
* Present the problem first, and allow the learner to arrive at the solution.
* Avoid overly formal or showy presentation.
* Open-ended work, worked examples, problem-based learning, simulations, and games.
* "Why?" -- Support the purpose of learning.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

* The flexibility of card formats allows using audio, images, and video.
* Cards can have requires, allowing for more involved projects based on problem-based learning.

## 8. Learn Together

We are more effective as team or as a community. Often, but not always.

### What do we mean by "Learn Together"?

* Allow more experienced learners to pair up and group up.
* Invite discussion at all levels.
* Use consensus to build.
* Communicate and log.
* Return to the community.
* Be honest with learners.
* Hold users accountable.
* Don't cover up non-private information.
* Invite and offer feedback regularly.
* Peer tutoring and mentoring.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

* Learners can work on cards together.
* Discussions are available for all cards, units, and subjects.
* Creating and editing content uses the consensus model.
* Everything is open source.
* Documentation throughout.
* Everything in the cards is public by default.
* Providing basic analytics to everyone means we can have more honest conversations.
* Everything is up for discussion and can be flagged.
* Sagefy is open source and is built on open source software.
