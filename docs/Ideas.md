The ideas are the foundation of Sagefy's architecture. The ideas are broad and based on highly common patterns in memory and learning research. Use the ideas to provide a sense of direction.

1. Do One Thing at a Time
2. Keep Organized
3. Use Prior Knowledge
4. Adhere to Goals
5. Make it Real
6. Dive Deep
7. Work Together

1) Do One Thing at a Time
-------------------------

Our memory system is powerful but limited. We are most effective when focusing on one task at a time.

### What do we mean by "Do One Thing at a Time"?

- Only do one specific activity at any given point in time.
- Avoid multitasking.
- Prefer one source of input and one source of output at a time.
- Scaffold the learner to success.
- Avoid unnecessary choices.
- Stay focused and eliminate tangents.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

- The user can only be presented one card at a time.
- The user only works on one unit at a time.
- When the learner must make a choice about which set or unit to pursue, the learner is only presented with the choice.
- A contributor can only change one entity at a time.

2) Keep Organized
-----------------

Our memory system works by forming relationships. Mastery is the result of an organized thought process.

### What do we mean by "Keep Organized"?

- Show how information is organized directly to the learner.
- Relate information to prior information.
- Task the learner with organizational challenges.
- Use technology to automate organization.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

- The three basic entities are easy to remember and have a clear hierarchy.
- Sets can embed each other, allowing for a variety of organizational structures.
- A card must belong to a unit, which defines its purpose.
- A unit can only have a single goal, limiting extraneous information.
- Requires are available for cards and units, allowing for the system to automatically keep things organized with low effort.
- Contributors do not organize courses, but simply describe relationships. The algorithms handle keeping things organized to the learner.

3) Use Prior Knowledge
----------------------

The strongest predictor of how much we will learn is what we already know. Every learning experience must be adapted to the learner's prior knowledge.

### What do we mean by "Use Prior Knowledge"?

- Adjust the challenge level to the learner's knowledge.
- Ensure a learner knows what they need to in order to complete a task.
- Focus on areas of weakness.
- Focus on building knowledge.
- Connect new information with prior knowledge.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

- Cards and units have requires, which ensures the learner has sufficient prior knowledge.
- The algorithms which sequence show cards, units, and sets that are available to the learner.
    - The algorithms which sequence the entities focus on improving the learner's prior knowledge.
    - A diagnostic assessment means learners can build prior knowledge where lacking.
    - A learner with high prior knowledge can skip to more relevant areas.

4) Adhere to Goals
------------------

Defining small, achievable goals and constantly checking against them builds better, more focused content.

### What do we mean by "Adhere to Goals"?

- Always define the goal.
- Focus content on exploring the different facets of the goal.
- Remove content that is not needed for the goal.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

- Units are defined by their goal, or objective.
- Cards must be attached to a unit.
- Sets can be small or large, but they always have a single description.
- Flagging enables users to remove irrelevant content.

5) Make it Real
---------------

We rely on real-life experiences to guide to our learning.

### What do we mean by "Make it Real"?

- Connect material with real life problems.
- Use images and videos to connect with the visual processing center.
- Present the problem first, and allow the learner to arrive at the solution.
- Avoid overly formal or showy presentation.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

- The flexibility of card formats allows using audio, images, and video.
- Cards can have requires, allowing for more involved projects based on problem-based learning.

6) Dive Deep
------------

Route memorizing isn't enough. We must be able to use our knowledge.

### What do we mean by "Dive Deep"?

- Go beyond route memorization. Challenge the learner to explain, analyse, apply, and synthesize.
- Build metacognitive capabilities.
- Go in for the long term. Use spaced repetition.
- Focus on developing areas of weakness.
- Remove barriers to going deep.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

- Sets can contain sets and units. Sets can scale out extensively.
- Cards are flexible in format. This flexibility means we can ask for more than comprehesion.
- By removing complexity in the data structure, we make room for more depth by adding flexibility.
- The system encourages spaced repetition to ensure maximum retention of knowledge.

7) Work Together
----------------

We are more effective as team or as a community. Often, but not always.

### What do we mean by "Work Together"?

- Allow more experienced learners to pair up and group up.
- Invite discussion at all levels.
- Use consensus to build.
- Communicate and log.
- Return to the community.
- Be honest with learners.
- Hold users accountable.
- Don't cover up non-private information.

### How does Sagefy implement this idea?

- Learners can work on cards together.
- Discussions are available for all cards, units, and sets.
- Creating and editing content uses the consensus model.
- Everything is open source.
- Documentation throughout.
- Everything in the cards is public by default.
- Providing basic analytics to everyone means we can have more honest conversations.
- Everything is up for discussion and can be flagged.
- Sagefy is open source and is built on open source software.
