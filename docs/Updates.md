title: Sagefy Development Updates

This is a reverse chronological listing of updates on Sagefy's progress. I will try to do these biweekly.

You can sign up for email updates at https://sgef.cc/devupdates



## UPDATE -- 2019 Jan 7

Thanks for signing up for the Sagefy development updates newsletter. I will be sending updates biweekly to help track progress on Sagefy.

### 2018 Nov 26 - 2019 Jan 6

* Been awhile! I've been mostly working on the updated database schema for the Sagefy V2 changes. Sagefy V2 focuses on allowing learning and contributing without signing in. There's some other upcoming technical changes (GraphQL support) to help make future development quicker.
* If you want to see where Sagefy V2 is going, check out [V2 Mocks](https://docs.sagefy.org/mocks/)! Feedback is welcome, you can reply to this email :)

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2019 Jan 7 - 2019 Jan 20

* Continue to work on updated [database schema](https://bit.ly/2FeLzUZ)... I'm about 85% of the way there with the new schema!

## UPDATE -- 2018 Nov 26

Thanks for signing up for the Sagefy development updates newsletter. I will be sending updates biweekly to help track progress on Sagefy.

### 2018 Oct 29 - 2018 Nov 25

* I'm still looking for more reviews of the [V2 Mocks](https://docs.sagefy.org/mocks/)! If you have some time, check out the mock pages for V2 Sagefy. Feel free to click around; everything is static demo content. Feedback is welcome, you can reply to this email :)
* Started work on updated database schema for V2.

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2018 Nov 26 - 2018 Dec 9

* Continue to work on updated database schema... I'm wanting to encode as much as possible at this layer, so the application code does very little work.

## UPDATE -- 2018 Oct 29

Thanks for signing up for the Sagefy development updates newsletter. I will be sending updates biweekly to help track progress on Sagefy.

### 2018 Oct 15 - 2018 Oct 28

* [V2 Mocks are ready for review!](https://docs.sagefy.org/mocks/) If you have some time, check out the mock pages for V2 Sagefy. Feel free to click around; everything is static demo content. Feedback is welcome, you can reply to this email :)
* I made a few style tweaks to the live site to get it slightly more similar to V2.

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2018 Oct 29 - 2018 Nov 11

* Iterate on V2 mocks.
* Begin requirements and service change investigation for V2.

## UPDATE -- 2018 Oct 15

Thanks for signing up for the Sagefy development updates newsletter. I will be sending updates biweekly to help track progress on Sagefy.

### 2018 Sep 17 - 2018 Oct 14

* I made some progress on the updated architecture, yet...
* I've conducted some more usability testing and review of analytics data.

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2018 Oct 15 - 2018 Oct 28

* Bigger picture (beyond the scope of two weeks), I'm shifting my efforts to address some major barriers to Sagefy's growth:
  * Remove needing to sign up to start learning or create content.
  * Make creating and updating content easier. (Even after last year's big update, is too difficult today.) 
  * Provide more capabilities with significantly less code, making it easier to adapt to learner and creator feedback.
* These next two weeks I'm working on some plain HTML mocks to try to address some of these larger, experience-level issues. I'm hoping the next update email is a request for feedback on the mocks :)

## UPDATE -- 2017 Oct 30

Thanks for signing up for the Sagefy development updates newsletter. I will be sending updates biweekly to help track progress on Sagefy.

### Recent Changes

Because this is the first newsletter, I'm including some of the highlights of the past few months. Normally this newsletter will be pretty short.

* Entirely new content creation system, based on usability testing.
* Created a test "suggest" page: suggest new subjects and upvote too. http://sagefy.org/suggest
* Created repeatable process and faster, easier local dev with Docker Compose.
* Some API endpoints have been split for greater flexibility.
* Migrated from RethinkDB back to PostgresQL.
* Updated service test coverage to 96%.
* Building out a full sitemap for Google indexing.
* Font update from Georgia to Rubik. Come check it out!
* Lots of minor copy changes and bug fixes, styling consistency updates and usability improvements.
* Several new posts on Medium. http://stories.sagefy.org/

### 2017 Oct 16 - 2017 Oct 29

**Page Card Kind**: Sagefy always had video cards and choice cards. I've added the ability to create page cards. Page cards are written content. For now, formatting options include bold, italic, headings, and embedding images.

There is a new page card for each of the 29 units in the Electronic Music subject. The content is the same as the video for each unit, just in written form instead of video. Here is an example https://sagefy.org/cards/PC9ac99ZQqWR-ZiEyP0wgw

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2017 Oct 30 - 2017 Nov 12

Beginning work on interactive examples -- using the Web Audio API -- of each of the 29 Electronic Music units. See the list at https://github.com/heiskr/sagefy-electronic-music

This will also be a new card kind, though I haven't picked a name yet.

### Upcoming major items in the backlog

* Completing interactive examples for Electronic Music subject.
* Updating the state management system for the client code.
* Rebuilding the suggest page based on feedback.
* Enable editing content from the web interface.

...and about 120 more tasks currently.
