### What problem do you solve?

Finding learning experiences can be a challenge. Cost can be a barrier. And even when you find something in budget, the content is often too easy or too difficult. And you don't know before you start. And often you find something similar to what you want to learn, but not specifically scoped to what you need to learn.

### Who has that problem?

People who are wanting to start their careers are particularly vulnerable. But even for people mid-career, spending time on content that is too easy or too difficult is wasteful. And even beyond careers, life-enriching learning can take a backseat when it costs too much or it isn't scoped to the learning goal.

### How do they describe the problem?

There's many complaints about the current state of learning. The school system is overly standardized. Postsecondary education is astronomically expensive. Classroom learning can be both boring and overwhelming. The MOOCs are putting most of their content behind paywalls, and the quality is highly variable. Flashcards are often free, but limited in what you can learn with them. Books are by definition not adaptive, and hard to stay motivated to read.

### How big of a problem is it?

I believe there's no greater opportunity for technology than human learning. If we can accelerate how people learn, we can change the trajectory of our species. With all of the problems with learning today, the opportunity is massive.

### How much would they pay for a solution?

For most learning, I suspect people will only do it if its free. Most people will only pay for learning if they expect to make income as a result of learning.

### What other solutions are out there?

There's many options already, see "describe the problem".

### How are you better / different?

1. We're free, and have zero intent of putting learning content behind paywalls. We can get income other ways. Some learning experiences out there are free as well, but not a majority.
2. We're open content. As far as I know, there is no other learning site out there that is completely open content. This means we can have very specific content and reach subjects no one else economically can.
3. We're adaptive. A few options in the market are gaining here, but Sagefy's design started with adaptive learning in mind. For the learner, this means avoiding spending time on boredom and overwhelm.

## Lean canvas

### Problem

- Learners waste time and effort on materials that don’t tightly fit their current level of knowledge.
- Learners have difficulty finding learning materials on more niche subjects they are interested in.
- A great deal of human knowledge is still locked up in pay-to-play systems.

### Solution

- Provide an open-content, adaptive learning platform to everyone, for free.
- Open-content allows for mass creation of a wide variety of content.
- Adaptive learning tightly matches learner prior knowledge.
- The combination is more powerful than the individual parts.

### Alternatives

- Classroom - Barely adaptive. Not open-content. Limited audience.
- Learning management systems - most traditional of edtech. Not open-content. Limited adaptive ability.
- Current adaptive learning systems - expert created content. Not generalizable.
- Massive open online courses - still expert created content. Not adaptive.
- Flash card systems - somewhat adaptive. Some open content. Limited options for types of content.
- Current open-content systems - non-adaptive. Have to create own learning path.

### Key Metrics

- Number of learners in the system - growth, engagement, retention
  - How many people start a subject
  - How many people complete at least one card
  - How many people complete at least one subject
- Amount of content created
- Quality of content created - how effective is the content at optimal time/effort given learner prior knowledge and goal

### Unique Value Proposition

- The combination of both adaptive learning and open-content, for free.

### Advantage

- I’m driven by the goal of making learning more effective, and I don’t care about making a profit.

### Channels

- Social media
- Email
- In website
- Blogging
- PR
- SEO
- Analytics, A/B, experimental testing to increase conversions (accounts, learning, creating content, donation)

### Customer

  - Job skills / career opportunities
  - Hobbies
  - Pursuit of knowledge
- Theoretically, organizations that want to run their own instances
  - Schools
  - Companies / non-profit organizations
  - Government

### Influencer

- Individual learners - themselves
- Organizations:
  - Trainers, edtech specialists, IT...

### Costs

- Technology services
  - Servers
  - Domains
  - Email
  - User support
- Staff (product, outreach, financial/organizational)
  - Payroll / accounting
- User acquisition

### Revenue
