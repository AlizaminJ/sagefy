Thanks for signing up for the Sagefy updates newsletter. I am sending updates biweekly to help track progress on Sagefy.

### 2019 Jun 10 - 2019 Jul 7

- A little off-cadence with this update :) I'm traveling soon so today's the day.
- There's now about 15,000 new cards in Sagefy! I did some natural language processing to summarize and generate multiple choice questions, and there's videos from YouTube and Vimeo now as well. The quality is about 10% great, 70% good, 10% interesting, and 10% messy.
- If you haven't seen it: https://twitter.com/sagefybyday <- A twitter bot that tweets a random Sagefy subject each day. Now even more fun with cards in the subjects :)
- Improved backup and deploy scripts
- Support for Vimeo videos
- Added schema.org information to the subject pages -- hopefully for some better Google indexing

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2019 Jul 8 - 2019 Jul 21

- Edit subject pages is high on the development list, so it'll be possible to clean up some of the NLP generated content.
- ...as is version history pages.

### 2018 Jan 7 - 2019 Feb 18

- So the site [changed last week](https://sagefy.org/) :)
- Things are limited now but moving. I'm finally on the updated tech stack. Most of the front-end and database schema are ready, so hopefully I can get this moving faster.

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2019 Feb 19 - 2019 Mar 3

- I'm going to try to get as much as I can on restoring user accounts (sign up, log in, reset password, settings, log out...). The plan after that is then anonymous & logged in learning, followed by "data pages" (search, view card...), then talk pages, and finally restoring the contributing experience.
- The next iteration will combine "units" and "subjects" into just "subjects". This change will reduce the cognitive load of creating content, and make for a more linear contributing process. This suggestion comes from usability testing feedback.

### 2018 Nov 26 - 2019 Jan 6

- Been awhile! I've been mostly working on the updated database schema for the Sagefy V2 changes. Sagefy V2 focuses on allowing learning and contributing without signing in. There's some other upcoming technical changes (GraphQL support) to help make future development quicker.
- If you want to see where Sagefy V2 is going, check out [V2 Mocks](https://docs.sagefy.org/mocks/)! Feedback is welcome, you can reply to this email :)

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2019 Jan 7 - 2019 Jan 20

- Continue to work on updated [database schema](https://bit.ly/2FeLzUZ)... I'm about 85% of the way there with the new schema!

- Started work on updated database schema for V2.

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2018 Nov 26 - 2018 Dec 9

- Continue to work on updated database schema... I'm wanting to encode as much as possible at this layer, so the application code does very little work.

## UPDATE -- 2018 Oct 15

Thanks for signing up for the Sagefy development updates newsletter. I will be sending updates biweekly to help track progress on Sagefy.

### 2018 Sep 17 - 2018 Oct 14

- I made some progress on the updated architecture, yet...
- I've conducted some more usability testing and review of analytics data.

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2018 Oct 15 - 2018 Oct 28

- Bigger picture (beyond the scope of two weeks), I'm shifting my efforts to address some major barriers to Sagefy's growth:
  - Remove needing to sign up to start learning or create content.
  - Make creating and updating content easier. (Even after last year's big update, is too difficult today.)
  - Provide more capabilities with significantly less code, making it easier to adapt to learner and creator feedback.
- These next two weeks I'm working on some plain HTML mocks to try to address some of these larger, experience-level issues. I'm hoping the next update email is a request for feedback on the mocks :)

- Created the new "unscored embed" card kind. Simply specify a URL and it will be embedded on the page! The name may seem silly... but there may be a "scored embed" and "peer-scored embed" in the future.

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2017 Nov 27 - 2017 Dec 10

- Build 5 interactive examples for the Intro to Electronic Music: Sound Parameters unit.
- Build 4 interactive examples for the Intro to Electronic Music: Human Hearing unit.

### 2017 Oct 16 - 2017 Oct 29

**Page Card Kind**: Sagefy always had video cards and choice cards. I've added the ability to create page cards. Page cards are written content. For now, formatting options include bold, italic, headings, and embedding images.

There is a new page card for each of the 29 units in the Electronic Music subject. The content is the same as the video for each unit, just in written form instead of video. Here is an example https://sagefy.org/cards/PC9ac99ZQqWR-ZiEyP0wgw

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2017 Oct 30 - 2017 Nov 12

Beginning work on interactive examples -- using the Web Audio API -- of each of the 29 Electronic Music units. See the list at https://github.com/heiskr/sagefy-electronic-music

This will also be a new card kind, though I haven't picked a name yet.

### Upcoming major items in the backlog

- Completing interactive examples for Electronic Music subject.
- Updating the state management system for the client code.
- Rebuilding the suggest page based on feedback.
