title: Cards, Units, & Subjects
---

_There are three types of entities in Sagefy: cards, units, and subjects._

- A **card** is a single learning activity.

  > Examples: a 3-minute video or a multiple choice question.

- A **unit** is a single learning goal.

  > Example: "What is mean, median, and mode?"

- A **subject** is a collection of units and other subjects.

  > Like a course, but at any scale. Such as "Measures of Central Tendency", "Intro to Statistics", or even a full degree program.
