**Question**: _How do we retain learners?_

- From "Strategies to Engage Online Students and Reduce Attrition Rates" by Lorraine M. Angelino, Keels Williams, and Deborah Natvig; The Journal of Educators Online, Volume 4, Number 2, July 2007.
    - Attrition rates in online courses are extremely high.
    - Surveys to generate feedback can help lower attrition rates.
        - Cites Nash 2005.
    - The biggest problem that cause attrition is learners having difficulty managing their time. Family problems, finances, child care, distractions, and jobs all act against online learning.
        - Cites Nash 2005, Martinez 2003
    - There's four big ways to fight attrition.
        - 1. Make students intregrated and engaged in the community. Require learners to participate socially in their learning. Early and frequent contact is critical.
            - Cites Tinto 1975, Towles 1993, Wojciechowski & Palmer 2005, Carnevale 2000, Hughes 2004, Minich 1996, Nash 2005
        - 2. Focus on a constructivist approach, rather than a teacher centered approach. Require the learner to constantly actively input. Require learner to shape own learning objectives.
            - Cites Diaz & Bontenbal, 2001; Minich, 1996; Anderson, 2004; Rovai, 2002; Tinto, 1993; Anderson, 2004; Carnevale, 2000
        - 3. Have learners work together in groups and communities to accomplish their goals. Online learners often feel isolated and unsupported.
            - Cites Anderson, 2004; Vygotsky, 1978; Wehlage, Rutter, and Smith (1989); Rovai, 2002; Tinto (1993); Rovai, 2002; Wilson, 2001)
        - 4. Provide online services to learners to support their learning. Tools like assessments, counseling, techincal support, study skills support, career counseling, and library support help keep learners engaged and supported.
            - Cites Hughes, 2004


**Question**: _Do learners learn more in a community or individually?_

- SE 184-188: A formal tone does not indicate the seriousness of the subject. Learners are more effective when they feel they are in a conversation with a partner. Social presence engages deeper cognitive processes.

- SH 156: "As educators we are primarily concerned with fostering intellectual and creative skills in our students, but we must recognize that students are not only intellectual but also social and emotional beings, and that these dimensions interact within the classroom climate to influence learning and performance."
- SH 157: "A negative climate may impede learning and performance, but a positive climate can energize students’ learning"
    - Cites Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991

**Question**: _Does anonymity or self-identification more effective for learning?_

- SH 182-183: Don't make learners feel anonymous; support the learning environment with involvement.

- SH 184: Establish feedback channels on the social learning environment.
- SH 171-174: There is a continuum between supportive and marginalizing learning environments.
    - Cites DeSurra and Church (1994), focused on LGBT learners
    - a) Explicitly marginalizing > hostile and unwelcoming
    - b) Implicitly marginalizing > sending a message that minority-based discussions not welcome
    - c) Implicitly centralizing > unplanned messages that validate minority-based perspectives
    - d) Explicitly centralizing > minority-based perspectives are integrated
    - Also cites (other groups) Hall, 1982; Hall & Sandler, 1984; and Sandler & Hall, 1986; Hall, 1982; Watson et al., 2002, and Hurtado et al., 1999); Pascarella and others (1997); Whitt and others (1999)
- SH 167-170: The Hardiman and Jackson model of social development breaks up people into two groups; dominant and minority learners. Their development mirrors
    - Cites Hardiman and Jackson 1992
    - a) Early childhood: Naive, unconcerned with social groupings
    - b) Messages are accepted about certain groups; minorities may adapt negative messages of their own group
    - c) Messages are challenged, resisted. Dominant groups feel guilt, minority pride and zealousness
    - d) Immersion, withdrawing to ones own grouping
        - Cites Fries-Britt (2000); Beverly Daniel Tatum (1997); Helms (1993); D’Augelli (1994); Rankin (2003)

**Question**: _How do we reduce trolling and nonproductive negative discussion?_

- SH 184: Establish feedback channels on the social learning environment.

    - Cites Nass & Brave, 2005;  Linek, Gerjets, and Scheiter 2010
