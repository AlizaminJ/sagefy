**Question**: _How important is promoting organizational knowledge? What strategies are effective to promoting learner organization through presentation?_

- SH 50: Learners tend to make simple and linear relationships in knowledge, which is vastly slower than a strongly connected network.
    - Cites Bradshaw & Anderson, 1982; Reder & Anderson, 1980; Smith, Adams, & Schorr, 1978; DiSessa 1982; Catrambone, 1995, 1998
- SH 52: Experts are greatly different than beginners in their knowledge organization. They use the highly connected models more easily and fluidly in application. Experts often make use of chunking, or combining information into small groups.
    - Cites Ericsson, Chase, and Faloon 1980; Ericsson & Staszewski, 1989
- SH 54: Learners tend to have superficial knowledge organizations, which makes them less effective at recall and learning new material.
    - Cites Chi & VanLehn, 1991; Hinsley, Hayes, & Simon, 1977; Ross, 1987, 1989
- SH 56: Expert organization results in far better recall of related information. Their knowledge organization is much more flexible as well.
    - Cites Chase & Simon, 1973a, 1973b; Egan & Schwartz, 1979; Lesgold, et al., 1988; Soloway, Adelson, & Ehrlich, 1988
- SH 57: Teachers can assist learners in building their organizational structures to learn more quickly and be able to transfer more effectively. Stories which relate facts to each other can improve recall.
    - Cites Bradshaw and Anderson 1982
- SH 60: Provide learners with concept maps, flowcharts, trees, and other visual representations of knowledge organization at the course level and every time at the lesson level. This will help learners develop deeper, better connected, more flexible organization of knowledge, and with it improve recall, retention, and applicability.
- SH 61: Use compare and contrast and boundary cases to show organizing features to learners. Ask learners to make predictions based on these conditions.
- SH 62: Explicitly make connections with prior knowledge.
- SH 63: Design practice and application projects that force learners to deal with multiple organizing structures. Categorization and sorting tasks are particularly helpful in developing organizational knowledge.
- SH 63-64: Asking students to draw their own concept map of their knowledge can expose the differences between expert connections and learner connections, and help them to develop more connected knowledge structures.
- SH 64: Throughout practice and application exercises, monitor learners for issues with the way they organize knowledge.
- SH 59-60: When planning practice and application exercises, identify tasks that will help build knowledge organization in addition to factual knowledge.
- SH 58: Learners who are presented with compare and contrast scenarios are better "prepared to learn from a lecture or reading assignment"
    - Cites Schwartz & Bransford, 1998
- SB 153-155: An "expository advance organize" outlines relevant prior knowledge at the beginning of a lesson.
    - Cites Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzell 2002; Clark and Mayer 2007; Shapiro 2005
- SB 145-148: Use "comparative advance organizers" to activate prior knowledge. This is a presentation that relates new information to existing information. An effective organizer explicitly links concepts.
    - Cites Ausubel & Youssef, 1963; Mayer and Wittrock 2006; Mayer, 1983; Kloster and Winne 1989
- SH 98: Experts organize information "into large, conceptual chucks" with aids with applying the knowledge flexibly; experts more quickly recognize patterns; experts are more likely to be able to traverse contexts
    - Cites Chase & Simon, 1973b; Chase & Ericsson, 1982; Koedinger & Anderson, 1990; DeGroot, 1965; Anderson, 1992; Chase & Simon, 1973a; Koedinger & Anderson, 1990; Blessing & Anderson, 1996; Smith & Chamberlin, 1992; Lansdown, 2002; Beilock, Wierenga, & Carr, 2002; Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981; Larkin et al., 1980; Boster & Johnson, 1989
- SE 77: Graphics can serve as "topic organizers", essentially acting as a way of showing the relationship between learning objectives.
- SH 230: Concept Maps > Read Novak (1998)
- SE 329: Use on screen navigational elements such as headers. Use links sparingly.
    - Cites Lorch, Lorch, Ritchey, McGovern, and Coleman (2001); Mayer (2005b); Neiderhauser, Reynolds, Salmen, and Skolmoski (2000); Shapiro (2008)

**Question**: _How effective are concept maps?_

- SE 330: Provide maps of the site and course. Use a simple hierarchical structure.
    - Cites Nilsson and Mayer (2002); Potelle and Rouet, 2003; Neiderhauser, Reynolds, Salmen, and Skolmoski (2000); Shapiro (2005, 2008)
- SH 149: Let learners also see their areas of strength and improvement to support motivation; learners are often unaware of their own progress.

**Question**: _Does presenting module organization improve learning?_

- SB 154: Site maps can improve learning; hierarchical structures are more helpful to novices than experts.
   - Cites Shapiro 2005.
- SH 46: Humans are pattern recognition machines; we focus on constructing casual relationships, shared meanings, and perceptual similarities.
- SH 47: Organization of thought has very real impacts on social organization and outcomes.
    - Cites Levi-Strauss, 1969; Stone, 2000
