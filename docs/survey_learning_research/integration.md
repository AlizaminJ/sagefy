**Question**: _How important is integrating knowledge to developing expertise? What strategies are effective to integrating knowledge?_

- SH 95: "To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned."
- SH 117: Performance criteria should explicitly require component integration to promote transfer.
- SB 243: Transfer is not hopeless. If learning are asked to explain reasoning, given good organizational knowledge, and shown multiple contexts, transfer is much more likely to happen.
