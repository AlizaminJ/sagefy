### How do we learn to apply knowledge?

- SB 240: To be able to transfer knowledge to other contexts, you must be able to explain why something is the way it is, not just what it is or how to do it.
    - Cites Kieras & Bovair, 1984
- SB 233-234: Transfer of learning is rare.
    - Cites Haskell 2001
- SB 238-239: The environment of the expected performance must support transfer of learning.
    - Cites Haskell 2001; Independent Commission Report, 1991
- SB 239-240, 242: General problem solving activities do not improve problem solving in other contexts.
    - Cites Mayer, 1999, 2004; Mayer and Wittrock 1996
- SB 243-247: Transfer exists at a variety of levels. There can be no transfer, near transfer (near-identical), moderate transfer (routine), and far transfer (adaptive).
    - Cites Bransford et al 2006, Weisberg 2006
- SB 248-249: Transfer is highly dependent on expertise; intelligence and talent are not significant factors.
    - Cites Schraw, 2006; Cattell 1943; Neitfeld, Finney, Schraw, & McCrudden, 2007

### Do real world tasks promote learning?

- SB 13: There is both routine expertise and adaptive expertise. Adaptive expertise can be applied to multiple contexts.
    - Cites Neitfeld, Finney, Schraw, & McCrudden 2007.
- SH 83: Real-world tasks can help transition goals from extrinsic and attainment to intrinsic.

### How can projects be made relevant to the learner?

### How can one learn to apply knowledge to appropriate contexts?

### How does prior knowledge impact project work?

- SH 16: Suggesting prior knowledge to apply to a problem improves performance dramatically.
    - Cites Bransford and Johnson 1972, Dooling and Lachman 1971

### Is peer feedback effective? When and what situations?

### How explicit is necessary for designing projects?

### Is self assessment effective in project work? What strategies can be used?

- SB 89-90: Aids, or small notes or reference cards, can help to manage cognitive load.
- SB 90-91: When a reference is necessary to complete a task, train using the reference to help reduce cognitive load.
- SB 92: Embed instructional aids and reference into the user interface early on.
- SB 94: To manage cognitive load, minimize the content. Write concisely. Omit details.
    - Cites Mayer, Bove, Bryman, Mars, and Tapangco (1996); Clark and Mayer, 2008; Mayer and Jackson (2005)
- SB 97: To reduce cognitive load, remove seductive details and tangential stories.
    - Cites Mayer (2005)
- SB 97-98: To reduce cognitive load, do not duplicate content between modes (audio and visual). Either have text or narration, not both.

    - Cites Mayer 2005, Tindall-Ford, Chandler, and Sweller 1997; Clark and Mayer 2008
- SH 178-180: Course content can impact the learning environment. If only the majority view is shown, or the majority view dominates, this can adversely impact outcomes.
    - Cites Marchesani and Adams (1992); Seymour and Hewitt (1997); Astin 1993
- SE 184-188: A formal tone does not indicate the seriousness of the subject. Learners are more effective when they feel they are in a conversation with a partner. Social presence engages deeper cognitive processes.
    - Cites Beck, McKeown, Sandora, Kucan, & Worthy, 1996; Mayer, 2005d; Moreno and Mayer 2000b, Moreno and Mayer 2004; Mayer, Fennell, Farmer, & Campbell 2004; Kartel 2010

- SB 366: Avoid creating emotional interest; instead focus on building situational interest. Use simple, minimal content; use vivid language and examples; and make things human and personal.
    - Cites Sadoski, Goetz, & Fritz, 1993; Strun and White 2000; Moreno and Mayer (2000b); Clark and Mayer (2008)
- SE 363: "Through the cognitive task analysis, you define: (1) scenarios to serve as learning cases, (2) criteria that distinguish scenarios of more or less complexity, (3) the normal tools and resources available to the worker, and (4) alternative solution paths and rationale."
    - Cites Lajoie, Azevedo, and Fleiszer (1998); Van Gog, Sluijsmans, Joosten-ten Brinke, and Prins (2010)
- SB 218: Wait at least three seconds after asking a question before going for the answer to promote building mental models.
    - Cites Tobin 1987.
- SB 209: Ask learners to take a position on a topic or controversy to promote building mental models.
    - Cites Wiley and Voss 1999
- SE 173: "Signaling includes using headings, bold, italics, underlining, capital letters, larger font, color, white space, arrows, and related techniques to draw the learnerâ€™s attention to specific parts of the display or page."
    - Cites de Koning, Tabbers, Rikers, & Paas, 2010; Harp & Mayer, 1997; Mautone & Mayer, 2001; Mautone & Mayer, 2001; Mayer, 2005b; Mayer & Moreno, 2003
- SB 364: To support mastery-based goals, measure learners against the learning objectives rather than each other.
- SE 159-164: Do not add graphics that do not support the learning objectives. They can distract, disrupt, and seduce the learner and add cognitive load.
    - Cites Mayer, 1993; Mayer, Sims, & Tajika, 1995; Dewey, 1913; Harp and Mayer 1998; Harp and Mayer 1998; Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Sanchez and Wiley 2006
- SH 128-129: Experts often do not make their feedback clear enough to learners, which interferes with deliberate practice. Tying the feedback to the learning objective can clarify the goal.
- SB 371: Add situational interest to support motivation.
    - Cites Means, Jonassen, and Dwyer (1997); Hidi and Renninger (2006); Means, Jonassen, and Dwyer,1997
- SH 95: "To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned."
- SH 106: Not all reductions to cognitive load promote learning; learners need to fully use their cognitive capacity on the task at hand rather than being distracted.
    - Cites Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003, 2004
- SH 107: Asking learners to apply their knowledge promotes near- and far-transfer. Transfer, by human nature, is not automatic and less likely to work when the contexts vary more.
    - Cites Singley & Anderson, 1989; McKeough, Lupart, & Marini, 1995; Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901; Reed, Ernst, & Banerji, 1974; Singley, 1995; Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1994; Singley & Anderson, 1989; Holyoak & Koh, 1987
- SH 107: Learners often fail to apply knowledge to contexts due to context dependence of their knowledge.
    - Cites Mason Spencer & Weisberg, 1986; Perfetto, Bransford, & Franks, 1983
- SH 109: Learners are more capable of applying knowledge when they can "combine concrete experience within particular contexts and abstract knowledge that crosscuts contexts". Practicing knowledge in multiple contexts promotes application and far-transfer.
    - Cites Schwartz et al., 1999; Judd, 1908; Gick & Holyoak, 1983
- SB 315: Routine expertise focuses on solving problems based on existing schemas. Adaptive expertise can reform schemas to problems.
- SB 287-289: Problem-based learning: focused around investigation of a case. There are four criteria:
    - Student-centered
    - Problem presented first, before anything else
    - Small group work to investigate
    - Problem used to identify knowledge needed
    - Cites Hmelo-Silver 2004, Norman 2004; Schmidt & Moust, 2000; Dochy, Segers, Van den Bossche, & Gijbels, 2003; Mamede, Schmidt, and Norman (2006)
- SB 304: Some of the issues with problem-centered instruction include problem quality (cites Schmidy and Moust 2000), not enough supports, and no opportunites for reflection or collaboration.
- SB 294: Four Component Instructional Design:
    - a) Far-transfer tasks
    - b) Supportive information
    - c) Near-transfer tasks
    - d) Drill and practice
    - Cites Van Merrienboer (1997) and van Merrienboer and Kester (2005); van Merrienboer, Kester, & Paas, 2006; van Merrienboer & Sweller, 2005, Nadolski and others (2001)
- SH 212: Teach learners there is more to learning than memorizing facts, that there is declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and contextual knowledge.
- SB 235-237: There are four major reasons why transfer of learning fails:
    - 1) Poor organizational knowledge
    - 2) Lack of specific creativity training
    - 3) Not training why things are, just how
    - 4) Not trained in context
    - Cites Gick & Holyoak, 1980, 1983
- SH 115: Practice to the point of fluency is required before attempting application of knowledge.
- SB 199-200: Simluations can greatly improve longer term learning outcomes.
    - Cites Taylor and Chi, 2006
- SB 212: Behavioral activity can actually interfere with learning, such as asking learning to generate their own organizers.
    - Cites Stull and Mayer 2007
- SB 220-221: Ask learners to explicitly explain the concepts in their own words.
    - Cites De Bruin, Rikers, and Schmidt 2007
- SB 240-241, 242: Knowledge and skills tend to be context-specific.
    - Cites Haskell 2001, Thorndike and Woodworth 1901
- SB 243: Transfer is not hopeless. If learning are asked to explain reasoning, given good organizational knowledge, and shown multiple contexts, transfer is much more likely to happen.
    - Cites Mayer & Wittrock, 2006
- SB 263-265: To promote far transfer, practice in a variety of contexts.
    - Cites Paas and van Merrienboer 1996; Quilici and Mayer 1996
- SH 180: Support uncertainy and ambiguity. Resist a single fact or correct answer.
- SH 181: Ask learners to give evidence of their opinions to foster a more supportive learning environment.
- SH 207: Try assignments where either learners are asked to a) only form a plan or b) implement a plan already provided.
- SH 207: Make planning an explicit part of the assignment.
- SH 208: Give learners a self-correction heuristic before submission to help support their metacognitive development.
- SB 282: Problem-based learning is actually quite old.
    - Cites Dewey (1916)
- SB 283: Problem-centered design promotes transfer
- SB 284: Learners rate problem-centered design more highly
    - Cites Vernon and Blake (1993)
- SB 284: Problems prompt learners to engage
- SB 285: Problem-centered design can cause cognitive overload to novices
    - Cites Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark. 2006
- SB 285: Problem-centered design helps to integrate knowledge
- SB 290: Problem-based learning doesn't yield better factual knowledge, but learners like it better and learn better problem sovling skills.
    - Cites Dochy, Segers, Van den Bossche, & Gijbels, 2003; Hmelo-Silver 2004; Dolmans and Schmidt (2006)
- SB 291-294: For problem-based learning, the problem should be open-ended, expert-guided, specified group tasks, available resources
    - Cites Hmelo-Silver (2004); Dolmans and Schmidt (2006); Mamede, Schmidt, and Norman (2006); Kumta, Psang, Hung, and Chenge (2003)
- SB 296: Four Component Instructional Design can impose cognitive overload.
    - Cites van Merrienboer, Kester, and Paas (2006)
- Case based learning
    - Cites Srinivasan, Wilkes, Stevenson, Nguyen, & Slavin, 2007
- SB 299: Sherlock > Read Gott & Lesgold, 2000
- SB 300: Low complexity problem-based learning can be more practical and still effective.
- SB 301: Other examples of problem based learning: cognitive task analysis (Cites Feldon 2007), simulation (cites Ericsson 2006), focusing on problem-solving processes.
- SB 283: A problem-centered design meets the following criteria:
    - A problem is presented in the intro
    - Authentic tasks specific to the domain
    - Problem is the "focal point" of teaching

### How do we ensure learners understand the task?

- SH 194: Learners often fail to assess the task at hand, instead relying own their previous experiences. Learners often need assistance knowing how to assess tasks, and need feedback on task assessment.
    - Cites Carey, Flower, Hayes, and others (1989)
- SH 205: Assess the learner's understand of the task first.
- SB 318: Most of us are very poor at self-assessment, which hurts developing metacognitive skills.
    - Cites Stone, 2000; Glenberg, Sanocki, Epstein, and Morris (1987); Eva, Cunnington, Reiter, Keane, and Norman (2004); Glenberg (1992); Violato and Luckyer (2006)
- SH 195: People are generally weak at evaluating their own strengths and weaknesses. Novice learners are more likely to evaluate themselves poorly than experts. This interferes with metacognitive processes.
    - Cites Dunning, 2007; Hacker et al., 2000
