**Question**: _Should the question be presented as text, image, audio, video, or an interactive game or simulation? When?_

- SB 35-40: Graphics can greatly improve learning, 1) especially for novice learners, and 2) when the graphic directly supports the learning objective.
    - Cites Clark and Mayer, 2008; Mayer and Gallini, 1990
- SE 67: Include both words and graphics.
    - Cites Halpern, Graesser, & Hackel, 2007; Pashler, Bain, Bottage, Graesser, Koedinger, McDaniel, & Metcalfe, 2007
- SE 71-74: Use graphics that support learning. Clark describes six types of graphics in learning environments: 1) decorative, 2) representational, 3) relational, 4) organizational, 5) transformational, and 6) interpretive. She recommends limiting decorative and representational graphics, and instead using relational, organizational, transformational, and interpretive graphics.
- SE 74-77: There are five types of graphics contents: a) fact, b) concept, c) process, d) procedure, and e) principle.
- SE 78: Graphics can serve as lesson interfaces, such as in simulation environments. (Think Myst)
- SE 81: Simple, line-based drawings tend to produce better learning outcomes than complex or details graphics. The details can increase cognitive load.
- SE 83: Graphics with narration words better for novices, more familiar learners don't need graphics quite as much.
    - Cites Mayer and Gallini (1990); Ollerenshaw, Aidman, and Kidd (1997); Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller, 1998, 2000; Mayer & Gallini, 1990; Ollerenshaw, Aidman, & Kidd, 1997; Kalyuga, 2005; Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller 2003
- SE 84-85: A series of static frames is more effective in most cases than true animations. Animations require more cognitive load to process, and take away learner control. Static frames provide learner control of pacing, and have lower cognitive load. There are exceptions.
    - Cites Betrancourt, 2005; Hegarty, Kriz, & Cate, 2003; Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, & Campbell, 2005; Tversky, Morrison, & Betrancourt, 2002
- SE 86: While most content is better presented as a series of static frames, motor skills (hands-on) are often better trained by animations.
    - Cites ChanLin, 1998; Wong, Marcus, Ayres, Smith, Cooper, Paas, & Sweller, 2009; Ayres, Marcus, Chan, & Qian, 2009
- SE 93-95: Embed words next to relevant parts of the graphics. Avoid separating text and graphics both between screens and within screens. When necessary, tooltips and hovers are preferable to separated graphics. Do not use legends.
    - Cites (on 106) Mayer, 1989b; Mayer, Steinhoff, Bower, & Mars, 1995; Moreno & Mayer, 1999a; (on 107) Chandler & Sweller, 1991; Paas & Van Merrienboer, 1994; Sweller & Chandler, 1994; Sweller, Chandler, Tierney, & Cooper, 1990; Pociask & Morrison, 2008; Florax & Ploetzner, 2010; Erhel and Jamet (2006); Ginns (2006); (on 108) Hegarty, Carpenter, & Just, 1996; Schmidt-Weigand, Kohnert, & Glowalla, 2010
- SE 96: Avoid separating text and graphics on screens with scrollbars. Try to let the user see both at the same time by embedding text, or use side-by-side text and images. This applies more to novices.
    - Cites (on 108) Holsanova, Holmberg, & Holmqvist, 2009; Mayer, Steinhoff, Bower, & Mars, 1995
- SE 99: Avoid using external links, prefer embedding external content or having external content come up in a small window that can be moved around.
- SE 99-100: Don't put caption text below images. Embed text or put it to the side.
- SE 101: Avoid animations while the learner is reading. Allow the learner to play the animation on command.
- SE 102: Keep the narration and graphics that correspond with the narration in sync and on screen/in audio at the same time.
    - Cites (on 109) Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992; Mayer, Moreno, Boire, & Vagge, 1999; Mayer & Sims, 1994; Baggett 1984; Baggett and Ehrenfeucht 1983; Ginns 2006
- SE 109: Keeping the audio and images in sync is broken when the presentation is long and students can't control the pacing.
    - Cites Mayer, Moreno, Boire, & Vagge, 1999; Micas & Berry, 2000
- SE 120-121: Do not narrate exercise instructions. Present them as text so the learner can reference them.
- SB 97: To reduce cognitive load, remove seductive details and tangential stories.
    - Cites Mayer (2005)
- SB 97-98: To reduce cognitive load, do not duplicate content between modes (audio and visual). Either have text or narration, not both.
    - Cites Clark & Mayer, 2008
- SB 104-105: To reduce cognitive load, represent spatial content with graphics rather than text.
    - Cites Marcus, Cooper, and Sweller (1996)
- SB 105-106: To improve cognitive performance, describe visuals with audio narration.
    - Cites Mayer (2005), Ginns (2005), Harskamp, Mayer, & Suhre, 2007
- SB 131-134: Integrating text and graphics can help reduce distractions.
    - Cites Mayer 2005, Tindall-Ford, Chandler, and Sweller 1997; Clark and Mayer 2008
- SE 273: Remove content from practice questions that does not directly support the learning objective; such as complex grpahics, background music, sound effects, and detailed descriptions.
    - Cites Knez & Hugge, 2002; Plant, Ericsson, Hill, & Asberg, 2005
- SH 127-128: Deliberate practice is far more effective than general practice. Deliberate practice focuses on area of weakness while receiving observation and feedback. Deliberate practice is the defining difference between experts.
    - Cites Ericsson, Krampe, & Tescher-Romer, 2003; Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996; Ericsson & Charness, 1994
