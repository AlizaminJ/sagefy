- SE 373: Games are very popular in online learning.
    - Cites Issenberg, McGaghie, Petrusa, Gordon, & Scalese, 2005; Anderson and Lawton (2009); Carson (2009)
- SE 379: Games and simulations in online learning often do not support learning objectives.

- SE 381: The type of game (shooter, adventure, racing etc) should match the learning objective.
    - Cites Van Eck (2007)
- SE 383: When using game for online learning, use the same principles to other forms of online learning; such as explanatory feedback and ask learners to explain results.
    - Cites Belanich, Sibley, and Orvis, 2004; Issenberg, McGaghie, Petrusa, Gordon, & Scalese, 2005; Moreno (2004); Moreno and Mayer (2005); Mayer and Johnson (2010)
- SE 386: When using games for online learning, avoid open architectures, and instead direct the learner.
    - Cites (Mayer, 2004); De Jong (2011); Mayer, Mautone, and Prothero (2002); Rieber, Tzeng, and Tribble (2004)
- SE 390-393: When using games for online learning, prefer simple games to manage cognitive load. Slowly add new features, adapt to prior knowledge, keep a good pacing, and conduct usability testing.
