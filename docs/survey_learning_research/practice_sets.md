### When is a series of questions more effective than single questions?

- SB 101-102: To reduce cognitive load, segment lessons into short chunks; and let learners be in control of the pace of the segments.
    - Cites Mayer and Chandler (2001)
- SE 266: Provide step by step feedback for processes.
    - Cites Corbalan, Paas, and Cuypers (2010); Shute, 2008
- SB 222: Ask learners about specific steps of a process, and which concepts apply to that step.
    - Cites Atkinson, Renkl, and Merrill, 2003
- SB 221: Ask learners to explain the correct answer to questions.
    - Cites Moreno and Mayer 2005
- SB 273-275: Guided discovery is more effective than open discovery, which cause too much cognitive overload. Start with a simple simulation, give explanatory feedback, optimize the pacing, and keep the interface simple.
    - Cites Mayer, 2004; Clark & Mayer, 2008; Lee, Plass, and Homer, 2006; Moreno (2004); Moreno and Mayer (2005); Van Merrienboer and Kester (2005)
- SE 345-355: A strategy to develop metacognitive skills is whole-task design, where a problem is given, and then broken into tasks to be reintegrated.
    - Cites Schmidt and Moust, 2000; Lajoie, 2009; Schmidt, Van der Molen, te Winkel, and Wijnen (2009); Albanese (2010); Lim, Reiser, and Olina (2009)
- SH 102: Whole-task practice is preferable to componetization if the task is either simple or if the task can't be broken down.
    - Cites Wightman & Lintern, 1985; Naylor & Briggs, 1963; Teague, Gittelman, & Park, 1994
- SH 102: Usually, building component skills and then combining them is more effective that whole-task practice. The skill level of the learner will greatly impact how much break-down is needed.
    - Cites White & Frederickson, 1990; Wightman & Lintern, 1985; Salden, Paas, & van Merrienboer, 2006; Clarke, Ayres, & Sweller, 2005; Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller, 2003
- SB 287-289: Problem-based learning: focused around investigation of a case. There are four criteria:
    - Student-centered
    - Problem presented first, before anything else
    - Small group work to investigate
    - Problem used to identify knowledge needed
    - Cites Hmelo-Silver 2004, Norman 2004; Schmidt & Moust, 2000; Dochy, Segers, Van den Bossche, & Gijbels, 2003; Mamede, Schmidt, and Norman (2006)
- SB 304: Some of the issues with problem-centered instruction include problem quality (cites Schmidy and Moust 2000), not enough supports, and no opportunites for reflection or collaboration.
- SB 294: Four Component Instructional Design:
    - a) Far-transfer tasks
    - b) Supportive information
    - c) Near-transfer tasks
    - d) Drill and practice
    - Cites Van Merrienboer (1997) and van Merrienboer and Kester (2005); van Merrienboer, Kester, & Paas, 2006; van Merrienboer & Sweller, 2005, Nadolski and others (2001)
- SH 212: Teach learners there is more to learning than memorizing facts, that there is declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and contextual knowledge.
- SH 118: Ask learners to take an idea and generalize it over various contexts.
- SH 118: Use compare and contrast to help learners transfer knowledge to appriopriate contexts.
- SB 243: Transfer is not hopeless. If learning are asked to explain reasoning, given good organizational knowledge, and shown multiple contexts, transfer is much more likely to happen.
    - Cites Mayer & Wittrock, 2006
- SB 260-262: To promote moderate transfer, teach how it works at the steps of the procedure.
    - Cites Kieras and Bovair 1984

### How many questions should go in a single set?
