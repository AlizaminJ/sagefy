**Question**: _Should learners be in control of the pacing of the presentation?_

- SB 101-102: To reduce cognitive load, segment lessons into short chunks; and let learners be in control of the pace of the segments.
    - Cites Mayer and Chandler (2001)

**Question**: _Is learner or program control more effective? When? Do choices improve or hinder learning?_

- SE 316, 318: Our low ability to self-assessment impacts our ability to make effective learning decisions
    - Cites Stone, 2000; Glenberg, Sanocki, Epstein, and Morris (1987); Eva, Cunnington, Reiter, Keane, and Norman (2004); Violato and Lockyer (2006); Moos and Azevedo (2008)
- SE 311-313: In elearning, learners can be completely in control of their learning. There are three basic types:
    - Content sequencing
    - Pacing
    - Learning support
- SE 313: A few common learner controls:
    - Menus
    - Links
    - Popups
    - Linear navigation (back, next, pause, play, quit)
    - Guided tours
    - Linked objects
- SH 89: Give learners flexibility and small choices throughout the course to lead the learners to believe they are in control of their own learning.
- SE 322-323: Make defaults available to learners when they are presented with choices.
    - Cites Schnackenberg and Sullivan (2000)
- SE 319-322: Learners with experience should be given more control over their learning. Novices should be more directed.
    - Cites Steinberg, 1989; Gay (1986); Young (1996); Lee and Lee (1991)
- SE 323-327: Make learning control adaptive to the skill level of the learner.
    - Cites (Kalyuga, 2005); Salden, Paas, Broers, and Van Merrienboer (2004); Corbalan, Kester, and van Merrienboer (2008); Kalyuga (2008); Salden, Aleven, Schwonke, and Renkl (2010)
- SE 327-328: All learners should be given control over the pacing of the course.
    - Cites Mayer and Chandler (2001), Mayer, Dow, and Mayer (2003), and Mayer and Jackson (2005); Tabbers and de Koeijer (2010)
- SB 324: Learner control depends on their metacognitive skills. Novices should be provided with a recommended path and provide a default path early on.
    - Cites Clark & Mayer, 2008; Schnackenberg and Sullivan (2000)
- SE 190: Polite wording improves learning, such as asking to continue instead of demanding it.
    - Cites Brown and Levinson 1987; Mayer, Johnson, Shaw, and Sandhu 2006;  Wang, Johnson, Mayer, Rizzo, Shaw, and Collins 2008; McLaren, DeLeeuw, and Mayer 2011
- SB 360-361: To support self-confidence, match the learning architecture (e.g. directed, guided discovery) to the learner's background.
    - Cites Kalyuga 2007
- SH 147: Adjust the goals and criteria over the period of the course to the learners.
