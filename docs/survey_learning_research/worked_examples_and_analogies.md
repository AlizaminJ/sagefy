**Question**: _How can analogies and examples activate prior knowledge?_

- SH 33: Analogies and examples can strongly connect existing prior knowledge to new information.
- SE 223-229: Worked examples are preferred by learners, and can reduce the time it takes to understand a concept. Worked examples are useful both for procedural and strategic tasks.
    - Cites  LeFevre and Dixon 1986; Atkinson, Renkl, and Merrill, 2003; Sweller & Cooper, 1985; Rourke & Sweller, 2009; Schworm & Renkl, 2007; van Gog, Paas, & van Merrienboer, 2008; Hilbert, Renkl, Kessler, & Reiss, 2008; Moreno & Ortegano-Layne, 2008; Moreno & Valdez, 2007

**Questions**: _How can one design effective worked examples?_

- SB 102-104: To reduce cognitive load, replace some practice exercises early on with worked examples.
    - Cites Sweller and Cooper (1985)
- SE 238-239: Teach major concepts before going through a worked example.
    - Cites Hilbert, Renkl, Kessler, and Reiss 2008; Renkl, Hilbert, and Schworm 2009
- SE 235-238: Present worked examples as simple graphics, integrated text, and with audio narration.
    - Cites Moreno and Valdez 2007; Moreno and Ortegano-Layne 2008; Leahy, Chandler, and Sweller 2003
- SB 269-273: To promote far transfer, show examples first, then ask the learner to derive the content, rather than presenting information
    - Cites Clark and Kwinn, 2007; Mayer 2002
- SE 227: An entire psychological model of learning is based on imitating others. Worked examples draw on this model.
    - Cites Sweller 2004
- SE 229-231: Smoothly transition from worked examples to problems. Ask learner more questions during the examples as time goes on. This is more applicable to novice learners
    - Cites Clark, Nguyen, and Sweller, 2006; Atkinson, Renkl, and Merrill, 2003; Kalyuga, 2007
- SE 231-234, 242-243: Ask learners to explain the steps during worked examples, and ensure learners know they will be asked to replicate.
    - Cites Chi and others 1989; Atkinson, Renkl, and Merrill, 2003; Chi, Roy, and Hausmann 2008; Craig, Chi, & VanLehn, 2009; Schworm and Renkl 2007; Quilici and Mayer, 1996
- SE 234-235: Explain the steps of the worked example, including why and how, when:
    - a) Conceptual understanding is the goal
    - b) There are no self-explanation questions
    - c) Math
    - Cites Renkl, Hilbert, & Schworm, 2009; Renkl 2011
- SE 238: Break the worked example into small segments with learner control.
    - Cites Atkinson and Derry 2000
- SE 240-242; 243-245: Show worked examples in a variety of contexts to support far transfer. Ask learners to compare varied contexts.
    - Cites Duncker, 1945; Gick & Holyoak, 1980; Quilici and Mayer 1996; Gentner, Loewenstein, and Thompson 2003
- SB 297-298: Sequencing tasks from simple to complex; provide process worksheets and steps; use worked examples; use small group learning
    - Cites Hummel, Paas, and Koper (2006)
- SE 302: Worked examples of argument discussion improve performance learning outcomes.
    - Cites Schworm and Renkl (2007); Yeh and She (2010)
- SB 185-187: Present examples to help build mental models.
    - Cites Anderson, Farrell, & Sauers, 1984; Lefevre & Dixon, 1986; Chi, 2000; Chi, DeLeeuw, Chiu, & LaVancher, 1994; Renkl, Stark, Gruber, & Mandl, 1998; Stark, Mandl, Gruber, & Renkl, 2002
- SH 183: Demonstrate inclusive "language, behavior, and attitudes." Use diverse examples.

**Question**: _When are worked examples more effective than practice?_

- _Needs research_

**Question**: _Do learners do better after observing expert practice?_

- SH 58: Walking learners through the expert analytical reasoning of a problem can help them see stronger relationships and connections.
    - Cites Gentner, Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003; McDaniel & Donnelly, 1996
- SB 117: Use competency demonstrations to keep learners focused and staying attention.
- SB 329-330: Include worked examples of metacognitive practice. Talk your thought process aloud as you work through a problem.
    - Cites Schoenfeld (1987); Lin, Hmelo, Kinzer, & Secules, 1999; Bielaczyc, Pirolli, and Brown (1995)
- SE 355-360: To help learners develop metacognitive skills, explicitly present thinking. Focus learners on expert thinking models.
    - Cites Schoenfeld, 1987; Moreno (2009); Van Gog, Sluijsmans, Joosten-ten Brinke, and Prins (2010)
- SH 147: Show examples of how much practice is required and what that practice looks like.


**Question**: _When are analogies and comparisons effective?_

- SB 187-189: Use analogies to promote building mental models. Analogies must draw on existing prior knowledge and draw from unrelated domains.
    - Cites Stepich & Newby, 1988; Newby, Ertmer, & Stepich, 1995
- SB 265-268: To promote far transfer, use compare and contrast of examples.
    - Cites Gentner, Loewenstein, and Thompson 2003
- SH 110: Structured comparisions promote transfer of knowledge to various contexts.
    - Cites Loewenstein, Thompson, and Gentner 2003; Gentner, Holyoak, & Kokinov, 2001; Catrambone & Holyoak, 1989; Holyoak & Koh, 1987; Klahr & Carver, 1988; Biederman & Shiffrar, 1987; Brown & Kane, 1988
- SH 118: Use comparisons to help learners transfer knowledge to appriopriate contexts.


**Question**: _Is it effective to see a comparison of an expert strategy versus a self devised strategy?_

- SB 328: Experts vary greatly in their metacogntive processes; experts spend more time on analysis, planning, and verification whereas novices focus on exploring.
    - Cites Schoenfeld, 1987

**Question**: _Is comparison exercises effective to knowledge integration? When and how?_

- _Needs research_
