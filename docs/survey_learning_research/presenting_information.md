### Is it effective to focus student attention? How can learner's know what information to value or specifically target? When is focusing student attention during presentation effective?

- SB 10: Expertise is domain specific and narrow; built on concrete and specific memory.
    - Cites Simon & Gilmartin, 1973.
- SB 117: To support learner attention, find the right balance of demands. Too much can be paralyzing, too little and there's no effort.
- SB 118: Asking frequent questions can sustain learner attention and focus.
- SB 121-124: Cueing, or signaling, can help to focus learner attention on critical aspects. Examples are arrows, bolding text, emphasizing spoken words...
    - Cites de Koning et al 2007, Mautone and Mayer 2001, Brophy and Good 1986; Rickards, Fajen, Sullivan, & Gillespie, 1997
- SB 128-129: Include the learning objectives to help learners focus their attention. Reiterate the learning objectives in information, practice, and assignments.
    - Cites Rothkopf & Billington, 1979; Cavalier & Klein, 1998
- SB 124-128: Insert questions into information, presentation, or instruction. This helps to focus learner attention.
    - Cites Van den Broek, Risden, Tzeng, Trabasso, and Brasche 2001; McCrudden and colleagues 2005

### Is note taking effective for learning? Can physical engagement improvement learning?

- SB 226-227: Note taking, and other purely behavioral activities, often removes focus from the learning event, and should be minimized. Instead, offer notes at the end of the lecture. Encourage elaborate rehearsal after lecture instead of route memorization.
    - Cites Kiewra, 1989; Kobayashi, 2005; Benton, Kiewra, Whitefill, and Dennison 1993

### Is it better to teach information as part of a process, or before teaching a process?

- SE 212-218: Before presenting processes, present the key concepts of the lesson first.
    - Cites Clark and Kwinn, 2007; Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzell, 2002; Kester, Kirshner, & van Merrienboer, 2006; Pollock, Chandler, & Sweller, 2002
- SB 189-191: Show how processes work to help build mental models.
    - Cites Kieras and Bovair, 1984
- SB 260-262: To promote moderate transfer, teach how it works at the steps of the procedure.
    - Cites Kieras and Bovair 1984
- SB 268-269: To promote far transfer, integrate why's and how's into the training.
    - Cites Van Gog, Paas, and van Merrienboer 2004
- SH 214: Show learners your own metacognitive processes.
- SH 211: Show learners multiple strategies to the same issue to support metacogntive development.
- SB 255: When teaching procedures, mimic the context of application.
- SB 260: To promote moderate transfer, show how the specifics of the procedure can be generalized.
    - Cites Mayer 2002

### Is formal or casual language more effective during presentation? Is it better to speak fully in third-person, or to use first- and second-person?

- SE 188: A casual tone does not have to be overly personal, it only has to be conversational.
- SE 184-188: A formal tone does not indicate the seriousness of the subject. Learners are more effective when they feel they are in a conversation with a partner. Social presence engages deeper cognitive processes.
    - Cites Beck, McKeown, Sandora, Kucan, & Worthy, 1996; Mayer, 2005d; Moreno and Mayer 2000b, Moreno and Mayer 2004; Mayer, Fennell, Farmer, & Campbell 2004; Kartel 2010
- SB 178-181: Use a conversational language and learning agent to support building mental models.
    - Cites Clark and Mayer 2008; Moreno and Mayer 2000b, 2004
- SE 195: Learning agents do not need to be realistic; their behaviors are important however.
    - Cites Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Craig, Gholson, & Driscoll, 2002; Lusk and Atkinson 2007; Louwerse, Graesser, McNamara, and Lu 2009
- SE 195-196: Learning agents need a realistic voice.
    - Cites Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Moreno & Mayer, 2004; Moreno and Mayer, 2000b; Atkinson, 2002; Atkinson, Mayer, and Merrill, 2005
- SE 197-201: Make the author of the content visible to the learner. This aids learner motivation.
    - Cites Nolen, 1995; Paxton, 2002; Beck, McKeown, Sandora, Kucan, and Worthy, 1996; Inglese, Mayer, & Rigotti, 2007
- SE 207-212: Break up large blocks of content into small, learner-controlled segments. Continuous presentation leads to cognitive overload.
    - Cites Moreno and Mayer, 1999a; Mayer and Chandler 2001; Moreno, 2007; Mayer, Dow, & Mayer, 2003; Schar and Zimmermann 2007
- SB 181-182: Learning agents do not have to be realistic to be effective.
    - Cites Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001
- SE 191-194: Teaching agents improve learning outcomes.
    - Cites Cassell, Sullivan, Prevost, & Churchill, 2000; Graesser, Jeon, & Duffy, 2008; Moreno, 2005; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Atkinson, 2002; Atkinson, Mayer, & Merrill, 2005; Rickel & Johnson, 2000; Lester, Towns, Callaway, Voerman, & Fitzgerald, 2000; Atkinson, 2002; Graesser, Jeon, & Duffy, 2008; Moreno, 2005; Moreno & Mayer, 2000b; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Wouters, Paas, & van Merrienboer, 2008
- SE 196: Learners do not need a choice of learning agents.
    - Cites Moreno and Flowerday 2006
- SB 362: To support self-confidence, include learning agents that describe their strategies.
- SB 183-184: Learning agents should engage the learner in "deep-level questions and answers". In fact, emulating a dialog can be as effective, if not more so, than actual interaction.
    - Cites Gholson and Craig 2006; Craig, Sullings, Witherspoon, and Gholson 2006

### When is textual presentation most effective?

- SE 99: Avoid using external links, prefer embedding external content or having external content come up in a small window that can be moved around.

### When are visuals most effective?

- SB 35-40: Graphics can greatly improve learning, 1) especially for novice learners, and 2) when the graphic directly supports the learning objective.
    - Cites Clark and Mayer, 2008; Mayer and Gallini, 1990
- SE 67: Include both words and graphics.
    - Cites Halpern, Graesser, & Hackel, 2007; Pashler, Bain, Bottage, Graesser, Koedinger, McDaniel, & Metcalfe, 2007
- SE 71-74: Use graphics that support learning. Clark describes six types of graphics in learning environments: 1) decorative, 2) representational, 3) relational, 4) organizational, 5) transformational, and 6) interpretive. She recommends limiting decorative and representational graphics, and instead using relational, organizational, transformational, and interpretive graphics.
- SE 74-77: There are five types of graphics contents: a) fact, b) concept, c) process, d) procedure, and e) principle.
- SE 79-82: Graphics with narration usually outperforms narration alone. States this is perhaps the most significant principle of e-learning.
    - Cites Mayer, 1989b; Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992; Mayer, Bove, Bryman, Mars, & Tapangco, 1996; Mayer & Gallini, 1990; Moreno & Mayer, 1999b, 2002b; Halpern, Graesser, and Hakel 2007; Institute of Education Sciences 2007; McCrudden, Schraw, & Lehman, 2009; McCrudden, Schraw, Lehman, & Poliquin, 2007; Moreno & Ortegano-Layne, 2008
- SE 83: Graphics with narration words better for novices, more familiar learners don't need graphics quite as much.
    - Cites Mayer and Gallini (1990); Ollerenshaw, Aidman, and Kidd (1997); Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller, 1998, 2000; Mayer & Gallini, 1990; Ollerenshaw, Aidman, & Kidd, 1997; Kalyuga, 2005; Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller 2003
- SB 104-105: To reduce cognitive load, represent spatial content with graphics rather than text.
    - Cites Marcus, Cooper, and Sweller (1996)
- SB 168-173: Using simple, relevant, annotated graphics can help to support the building of mental models (schemas).
    - Cites Clark and Mayer 2008; Mayer 2001; Butcher 2006; Brunye et al 2006; Brewer, Harvey, and Semmler 2004
- SB 173-177: There are several types of graphics: a) decorative, b) representative, c) organizational, d) transformational, and e) interpretive. Visuals that explain relationships, organizationals, changes, and interpretation help build mental models implicitly. This is caused by dual encoding, or providing two memory sources in different channels.
    - Cites Clark and Lyons 2004; Mayer, Sims, & Tajika, 1995; Woodward, 1993; Paivio 1986; Butcher 2006
- SB 219-220: Use graphics to promote building mental models.
    - Cites Natter and Berry 2005; Stern, Aprea, and Ebner 2003; Cosmides and Tooby 1996; Stull and Mayer 2007

### When is audio most effective?

- SE 102: Keep the narration and graphics that correspond with the narration in sync and on screen/in audio at the same time.
    - Cites (on 109) Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992; Mayer, Moreno, Boire, & Vagge, 1999; Mayer & Sims, 1994; Baggett 1984; Baggett and Ehrenfeucht 1983; Ginns 2006
- SE 109: Keeping the audio and images in sync is broken when the presentation is long and students can't control the pacing.
    - Cites Mayer, Moreno, Boire, & Vagge, 1999; Micas & Berry, 2000
- SE Ch6 : Narrate text (audio only) rather than presenting text on screen whenever possible. Learners have two channels, auditory and visual, to receive information, and two methods of processing, verbal and spatial. Narration with simple graphics and symbols utilizes both channels and methods efficiently. This applies more to novice learners.
    - Cites Craig, Gholson, & Driscoll, 2002; Mayer, Dow, & Mayer, 2003; Mayer & Moreno, 1998; Moreno & Mayer, 1999a; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Moreno & Mayer 2002b; Oâ€™Neil, Mayer, Herl, Niemi, Olin, & Thurman, 2000; Harskamp, Mayer, & Suhre, 2007; Schmidt-Weigand, Kohnert, & Glowalla, 2010a, 2010b; Seufert, Schutze, & Brunken, 2009; Ginns 2005
- SB 105-106: To improve cognitive performance, describe visuals with audio narration.
    - Cites Mayer (2005), Ginns (2005), Harskamp, Mayer, & Suhre, 2007
- SB 131-134: Integrating text and graphics can help reduce distractions.
    - Cites Mayer 2005, Tindall-Ford, Chandler, and Sweller 1997; Clark and Mayer 2008
- SE 153-159: Do not add extra audio, such as background music or sound effects. It will not improve engagement and it will increase cognitive load.
    - Cites Bishop, Amankwaita, and Cates (2008); Mayer & Johnson, 2010; Svetcov, 2000; Dewey 1913; Moreno and Mayer 2000a; Knez and Hygge 2002; Ransdell and Gilroy 2001

### Is animation or a set of static images more effective?

- SE 84-85: A series of static frames is more effective in most cases than true animations. Animations require more cognitive load to process, and take away learner control. Static frames provide learner control of pacing, and have lower cognitive load. There are exceptions.
    - Cites Betrancourt, 2005; Hegarty, Kriz, & Cate, 2003; Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, & Campbell, 2005; Tversky, Morrison, & Betrancourt, 2002
- SE 81: Simple, line-based drawings tend to produce better learning outcomes than complex or details graphics. The details can increase cognitive load.
- SE 86: While most content is better presented as a series of static frames, motor skills (hands-on) are often better trained by animations.
    - Cites ChanLin, 1998; Wong, Marcus, Ayres, Smith, Cooper, Paas, & Sweller, 2009; Ayres, Marcus, Chan, & Qian, 2009
- SE 101: Avoid animations while the learner is reading. Allow the learner to play the animation on command.
- SB 98-99: To reduce cognitive load, minimize the use of animations. A series of static frames where the user has control of pacing is often produces better outcomes.
    - Cites Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, and Campbell (2005); Schar & Zimmermann, 2007
- SE 164-166: Prefer simple graphics, such as basic line drawings, to detailed or complex graphics.
    - Cites Butcher 2006; Scheiter, Gerjets, Huk, Imhof, and Kammerer 2009;  Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, and Campbell 2005

### Is it better to present information in multiple formats or to reduce redundancy?

- SE 133-141, 144-146: Either have text on screen, or narrate the graphics on screen. "Do not add on-screen text to narrated graphics." Learners will use their visual processing when it isn't needed and it will increase cognitive load.
    - Cites Mayer 2001a, Mayer 2005b; Craig, Gholson, & Driscoll, 2002; Mayer, Heiser, & Lonn, 2001; Moreno & Mayer, 2002a; Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller 1999, 2000; Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller 2004; Jamet and Le Bohec 2007; Moreno and Mayer 2002b; Mayer and Johnson 2008

### When are simulations effective for information presentation?

- SB 255-257: To promote transfer to specific context, use simulations of that context.
    - Cites Issenberg 2005

### Is it better to present text within graphics or below graphics?

- SE 93-95: Embed words next to relevant parts of the graphics. Avoid separating text and graphics both between screens and within screens. When necessary, tooltips and hovers are preferable to separated graphics. Do not use legends.
    - Cites (on 106) Mayer, 1989b; Mayer, Steinhoff, Bower, & Mars, 1995; Moreno & Mayer, 1999a; (on 107) Chandler & Sweller, 1991; Paas & Van Merrienboer, 1994; Sweller & Chandler, 1994; Sweller, Chandler, Tierney, & Cooper, 1990; Pociask & Morrison, 2008; Florax & Ploetzner, 2010; Erhel and Jamet (2006); Ginns (2006); (on 108) Hegarty, Carpenter, & Just, 1996; Schmidt-Weigand, Kohnert, & Glowalla, 2010
- SE 96: Avoid separating text and graphics on screens with scrollbars. Try to let the user see both at the same time by embedding text, or use side-by-side text and images. This applies more to novices.
    - Cites (on 108) Holsanova, Holmberg, & Holmqvist, 2009; Mayer, Steinhoff, Bower, & Mars, 1995
- SE 99-100: Don't put caption text below images. Embed text or put it to the side.

### Are learning agents effective?

- _Needs notes_

### What strategies for learning agents are effective?

- _Needs notes_

### Do learning styles greatly impact learning outcomes?

- Learning styles is a theory that breaks up learners by format, such as visual, auditory, and kinetic.
- According to [The Myth of Learning Styles](http://elearningindustry.com/the-myth-of-learning-styles), learning styles are not a strong predictor of learning outcomes.
- SE 15-16: Learning styles do not significantly impact learning outcomes.
    - Clark 2012, Pashler, Bain, Bottage, Graesser, Koedinger, McDaniel and Metclafe 2007.
- SE 137: Learning styles have no evidence to support altering instructional formats despite their popularity.
    - Cites Pashler, McDaniel, Rohrer, and Bjork (2008)
