**Question**: _Is it effective to focus student attention? How can learner's know what information to value or specifically target? When is focusing student attention during presentation effective?_

- SB 10: Expertise is domain specific and narrow; built on concrete and specific memory.
    - Cites Simon & Gilmartin, 1973.
- SB 117: To support learner attention, find the right balance of demands. Too much can be paralyzing, too little and there's no effort.
- SB 118: Asking frequent questions can sustain learner attention and focus.
- SB 121-124: Cueing, or signaling, can help to focus learner attention on critical aspects. Examples are arrows, bolding text, emphasizing spoken words...
    - Cites de Koning et al 2007, Mautone and Mayer 2001, Brophy and Good 1986; Rickards, Fajen, Sullivan, & Gillespie, 1997
- SB 128-129: Include the learning objectives to help learners focus their attention. Reiterate the learning objectives in information, practice, and assignments.
    - Cites Rothkopf & Billington, 1979; Cavalier & Klein, 1998
- SB 124-128: Insert questions into information, presentation, or instruction. This helps to focus learner attention.
    - Cites Van den Broek, Risden, Tzeng, Trabasso, and Brasche 2001; McCrudden and colleagues 2005

**Question**: _Is note taking effective for learning? Can physical engagement improvement learning?_

- SB 226-227: Note taking, and other purely behavioral activities, often removes focus from the learning event, and should be minimized. Instead, offer notes at the end of the lecture. Encourage elaborate rehearsal after lecture instead of route memorization.
    - Cites Kiewra, 1989; Kobayashi, 2005; Benton, Kiewra, Whitefill, and Dennison 1993

**Question**: _Is it better to teach information as part of a process, or before teaching a process?_

- SE 212-218: Before presenting processes, present the key concepts of the lesson first.
    - Cites Clark and Kwinn, 2007; Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzell, 2002; Kester, Kirshner, & van Merrienboer, 2006; Pollock, Chandler, & Sweller, 2002
- SB 189-191: Show how processes work to help build mental models.
    - Cites Kieras and Bovair, 1984
- SB 260-262: To promote moderate transfer, teach how it works at the steps of the procedure.
    - Cites Kieras and Bovair 1984
- SB 268-269: To promote far transfer, integrate why's and how's into the training.
    - Cites Van Gog, Paas, and van Merrienboer 2004
- SH 214: Show learners your own metacognitive processes.
- SH 211: Show learners multiple strategies to the same issue to support metacogntive development.
- SB 255: When teaching procedures, mimic the context of application.
- SB 260: To promote moderate transfer, show how the specifics of the procedure can be generalized.
    - Cites Mayer 2002

**Question**: _Is formal or casual language more effective during presentation? Is it better to speak fully in third-person, or to use first- and second-person?_

- SE 188: A casual tone does not have to be overly personal, it only has to be conversational.
- SE 184-188: A formal tone does not indicate the seriousness of the subject. Learners are more effective when they feel they are in a conversation with a partner. Social presence engages deeper cognitive processes.
    - Cites Beck, McKeown, Sandora, Kucan, & Worthy, 1996; Mayer, 2005d; Moreno and Mayer 2000b, Moreno and Mayer 2004; Mayer, Fennell, Farmer, & Campbell 2004; Kartel 2010
- SB 178-181: Use a conversational language and learning agent to support building mental models.
    - Cites Clark and Mayer 2008; Moreno and Mayer 2000b, 2004
- SE 195: Learning agents do not need to be realistic; their behaviors are important however.
    - Cites Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Craig, Gholson, & Driscoll, 2002; Lusk and Atkinson 2007; Louwerse, Graesser, McNamara, and Lu 2009
- SE 195-196: Learning agents need a realistic voice.
    - Cites Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Moreno & Mayer, 2004; Moreno and Mayer, 2000b; Atkinson, 2002; Atkinson, Mayer, and Merrill, 2005
- SE 197-201: Make the author of the content visible to the learner. This aids learner motivation.
    - Cites Nolen, 1995; Paxton, 2002; Beck, McKeown, Sandora, Kucan, and Worthy, 1996; Inglese, Mayer, & Rigotti, 2007
- SE 207-212: Break up large blocks of content into small, learner-controlled segments. Continuous presentation leads to cognitive overload.
    - Cites Moreno and Mayer, 1999a; Mayer and Chandler 2001; Moreno, 2007; Mayer, Dow, & Mayer, 2003; Schar and Zimmermann 2007
- SB 181-182: Learning agents do not have to be realistic to be effective.
    - Cites Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001
- SE 191-194: Teaching agents improve learning outcomes.
    - Cites Cassell, Sullivan, Prevost, & Churchill, 2000; Graesser, Jeon, & Duffy, 2008; Moreno, 2005; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Atkinson, 2002; Atkinson, Mayer, & Merrill, 2005; Rickel & Johnson, 2000; Lester, Towns, Callaway, Voerman, & Fitzgerald, 2000; Atkinson, 2002; Graesser, Jeon, & Duffy, 2008; Moreno, 2005; Moreno & Mayer, 2000b; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; Wouters, Paas, & van Merrienboer, 2008
- SE 196: Learners do not need a choice of learning agents.
    - Cites Moreno and Flowerday 2006
- SB 362: To support self-confidence, include learning agents that describe their strategies.
- SB 183-184: Learning agents should engage the learner in "deep-level questions and answers". In fact, emulating a dialog can be as effective, if not more so, than actual interaction.
