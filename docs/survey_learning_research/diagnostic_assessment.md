**Question**: _Does identifying prerequisite knowledge improve learning?_

- SH 100: Novices tend to have lower performance in part of lacking all the component skills.
    - Cites Resnick, 1976; Lovett 2001
- SH 108: Learner can fail to apply knowledge when their do not have a sufficient knowledge of the component skills.
- SH 114: Review existing educational materials to discover ways to decompose tasks.
- SB 362: To support self-confidence, provide specific prerequisites.

**Question**: _How effective are diagnostic assessments?_

- SE 325-326: Adaptive diagnostic assessments take less than one third the time of traditional diagnostic assessment, and yield very similar results.
    - Cites Kalyuga 2008. When less is more in cognitive diagnosis: A rapid online method for diagnosing learner task-specific expertise. Journal of Educational Psychology, 100, 603â€“612.
- SE 408: Diagnostic assessment when learners lack self-regulation and learners are diverse in their prior knowledge.
- SH 28: Diagnostic assessment effectively identifies areas of missing or inappropriate prior knowledge. Authors also suggest concept inventory type of questions during diagnostic assessment.
- SH 86: Keep the level of challenge appriopriate to the learner to keep learners motivated. Preassessment can help identify the correct level of challenge.
- SH 28: Diagnostic assessment can help to channel and activate existing prior knowledge, find areas of weaknesses, and to identity inappropriate and inaccurate existing knowledge.
- SH 145: A diagnostic assessment helps to support deliberate practice by providing the right level of challenge.

**Question**: _What are the best types of diagnostic assessments?_

- SB 62: Diagnostic assessments can be used to evaluate metacognitive skills. This can help to determine an appropriate level of learner control.
    - 321-322: Provides an example of this sort of diagnostic assessment.
- SH 30: A concept map strategy can speed up diagnostic assessment by helping to identify missing and misconnected knowledge.
- SH 29: In diagnostic assessment, ask students if they are a) familiar, b) know the facts, c) can explain it, and d) can apply the information.
- SB 364: To support mastery-based goals, measure learners against the learning objectives rather than each other.

**Question**: _How accurate is self-assessment of prior knowledge?_

- SB 318: Several studies suggest self-assessment is very poor.
    - Cites Stone 2000; Glenberg, Sanokci, Epstein, and Morris 1987; Eva, Cunnington, Reiter, Keane, and Norman 200; Glenberg 1992
- SB Ch14: Diagnostic assessment is an ongoing event. It helps the learner to accurately identify their own skill level.
- SH 29: If you ask learners to assess their own prior knowledge, be sure to know if they are a) just familiar, b) factual, c) conceptual, d) able to apply to various contexts.
- SH 18: Declarative knowledge (what), and procedural knowledge (how) are very different, and often assumed to be the same. Often learners confident in declarative knowledge will assume procedural knowledge they don't have.
    - Cites Clement 1982
- SB 318: Most of us are very poor at self-assessment, which hurts developing metacognitive skills.
    - Cites Stone, 2000; Glenberg, Sanocki, Epstein, and Morris (1987); Eva, Cunnington, Reiter, Keane, and Norman (2004); Glenberg (1992); Violato and Luckyer (2006)
- SB 319: Learners are poor at assessing the style that best suits them.
    - Cites Schnackenberg, Sullivan, Leader, and Jones (1998)
- SH 195: People are generally weak at evaluating their own strengths and weaknesses. Novice learners are more likely to evaluate themselves poorly than experts. This interferes with metacognitive processes.
    - Cites Dunning, 2007; Hacker et al., 2000
- SE 316, 318: Our low ability to self-assessment impacts our ability to make effective learning decisions
    - Cites Stone, 2000; Glenberg, Sanocki, Epstein, and Morris (1987); Eva, Cunnington, Reiter, Keane, and Norman (2004); Violato and Lockyer (2006); Moos and Azevedo (2008)

**Question**: _Is remediation effective to improving learning outcomes?_

- SB 148-149: Delivering expected prior knowledge in methods that account for novices (graphical presentation) improves performance.
- SB 154: "Expository organizers" can greatly improve score for unfamiliar learners.
   - Cites Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzell 2002.
- SH 34: Identifying required prior knowledge and remediating where appropriate can greatly improve performance. This required knowledge may include conceptual, procedural, and application knowledge in addition to factual knowledge.
- SH 114: Diagnosing and correctly weak component skills will help learners to develop mastery.

**Question**: _What methods can be used to assess learner organizational knowledge?_

- _Needs research_

**Question**: _What do we know about knowledge spaces and learning outcomes?_

- _Needs research_
