**Question**: _Is it effective to guide learners through the project process?_

- SB 118: Asking frequent questions can sustain learner attention and focus.
- SE 266: Provide step by step feedback for processes.
    - Cites Corbalan, Paas, and Cuypers (2010); Shute, 2008
- SB 222: Ask learners about specific steps of a process, and which concepts apply to that step.
    - Cites Atkinson, Renkl, and Merrill, 2003
- SH 191: "To become self-directed learners, students must learn to assess the demands of the task, evaluate their own knowledge and skills, plan their approach, monitor their progress, and adjust their strategies as needed."
- SH 192-193: There are essentially five cyclical steps to metacognition:
    - a) Assess the task
    - b) Evaluate the self
    - c) Plan
    - d) Apply and monitor
    - e) Reflect
- SH 215: Scaffold learners in their metacognitive processes by starting with a ton of aids, and gradually weaning them off.
- SB 330-331: Ask learners questions as they practice to develop their self-monitoring skills.

**Question**: _Can project work aid intellectual development? How?_

- SB 364-365: To support mastery-based goals, encourage learners to attribute success and failure to things within their control.
- SB 320: Metacognitive skills are not hopeless.
    - Cites Hacker, Bol, Horgan, and Rakow (2000)
- SB 324: Supporting metacognitive skills improves transfer.
    - Cites Azevedo and Cromley, 2004
- SB 327-328: Metacognitive skills are highly domain-specific.
    - Cites Perkins & Saloman, 1989; Gott & Lesgold, 2000
- SB 331-332: To support metacognitive development, create an environment where mistakes are okay.
    - Cites Gott & Lesgold, 2000
- SB 316: Defines four components of metacognitive skills: a) setting goals, b) planning, 3) monitoring, and 4) making adjustments.
    - Cites Greene and Azevedo (2007)

**Question**: _How can one learn effective planning strategies?_

- SH 88: Provide learners with study strategies early in the course so they will stay motivated throughout the course.
- SB 321: Provide learners with explicit opportunities to practice their metacognitive skills.
    - a) Ask learners to assess themselves
    - b) Provide support during training
    - c) Design training to support metacognitive skills
- SB 365: To support mastery-based goals, assess both process and outcomes.
- SE 361: When asking learners to assess a task, try one of the following techniques:
    - Concurrent reporting (verbalize thoughts during)
    - Retrospective reporting (verbalize thoughts after)
    - Cued retrospective reporting (verbalize thoughts after, while recording)
    - Critical decision method (learner interviews expert)
    - Structured expert interview
- SE 360: To help learners develop metacognitive skills, ask them to reflect on their experiences.
- SH 196: Learners are just as likely to plan incorrectly as we are to underplan.
    - Cites Chi et al., 1989; Hayes & Flower, 1986; Schoenfeld, 1987; Carey et al., 1989
- SH 197-198: Learners should be prompted regularly, either by themselves or externally, "Is this plan working, or would something else work better?" This greatly supports metacognitive processes.
    - Cites Chi et al., 1989; Bielaczyc, Pirolli, & Brown, 1995; Chi et al., 1994; Palinscar & Brown, 1984
- SH 199: Good problems solvers change strategies more frequently.
    - Cites National Research Council, 2001, p. 78; Hayes & Flower, 1986
- SH 199: Many learners will stick to a moderately successful strategy rather than using a new strategy.
    - Cites Fu & Gray, 2004
- SH 206: Give learners opportunities in the course to evaluate themselves.
- SH 212: Directly intervene on student's beliefs about their own learning to support the idea that they are in control of their learning.

**Question**: _Is required reflection effective? What strategies are effective for reflection activities?_

- SH 89: Provide moments for learners to reflect on their experiences to keep them motivated. Ask questions such as "What did you learn from this project?" and "What was the most valuable part of this assignment?" "How would you approach this differently in the future?"
- SH 209: Require learners to reflect on their experiences and keep a log of their work to help support development of strategies. Such questions as
    - What did you learn?
    - What do you need to wkro on?
    - What would you do differently?
    - How have you progressed?
- SH 210-211: Ask learners to complete a "exam wrapper" to evaluate their own study skills. Ask learners:
    - What type of errors do you make?
    - How did you study?
    - What would you do differently?

**Question**: ???

- SB 326: Include how to study the content in the learning object; and include forced monitoring of progress in the course.
