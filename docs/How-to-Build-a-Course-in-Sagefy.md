title: How to Build a Course in Sagefy
---

Thank you for your interest and support of Sagefy!

I'll try to walk through the process of making a course in Sagefy on this page. Sagefy is still a bit rough, so just keep that in mind if you're going through this process. Feel free to email me at any time at <support@sagefy.org> if you run into problems or need any clarification. I'll be updating this page as I get feedback and experience. We're in this journey together. :smile:

For this page, I'm going to talk about the "Introduction to Electronic Music" course I've been building. If you haven't already, check out the [Cards, Units, & Subjects](Cards-Units-Subjects) before you get started. You can think of a 'subject' as being a class, a 'unit' as a learning objective, and a card as an individual type of learning activity. Right now Sagefy only supports video cards and multiple choice cards, but more types are planned. If you have a need for a specific type of card, let me know and I'll try to see if I can get that live.

### 1. Planning your units and subjects

For this part, you'll need to break down your course into units. Here's the process I followed:

1. Break down your course into a list of small topics. It should be broken down so each topic would be about 3-5 minutes of video.
2. Group those topics as you'd like.
3. Figure out what subjects you'd like to make based on those groupings. You can make groupings as deep or as shallow as you'd like. Maybe for your content, it makes sense to only have one overall subject. Maybe it makes sense to have one parent subject and 5 child subjects. Or maybe 1 grandparent, 3 parents, and 10 children. Whatever makes sense for your content.
4. Write a description for each subject, and indicate which subject belongs to which subject.
5. Create a goal for each unit.
6. For each unit, write down what units are required to happen *before* that unit.

So the first thing I did when I wanted to create my "Introduction to Electronic Music" course was I listed out the topics I wanted to cover. So for this course, my list is:

1. Introduction to Electronic Music [Subject]
  1. Foundation [Subject]
    1. Definition [Unit]
    2. Sound Parameters [Unit]
    3. Human Hearing [Unit]
    4. Hearing Curves [Unit]
    5. Digital Representation [Unit]
    6. Analog to Digital [Unit]
    7. Complex Waves [Unit]
  2. Creating Sound [Subject]
    1. ... [Unit]
  3. Changing Sound [Subject]
    1. ... [Unit]
  4. Complex Techniques [Subject]
    1. ... [Unit]
  5. Systems [Subject]
    1. ... [Unit]

Each of these topics will correlate with a single unit. You might find that your topics are too large for one unit and need to be broken down. I've been trying to keep my content in video lengths of about 3-5 minutes and about 10-20 multiple choice questions per unit at this time.

So you can see from this, I have one 'full' course, but within that there are subgroups of units. In Sagefy, these groups of units are subjects. The full course is simply a subject of subjects. A subject can be as small as just two units put together, or as large as a full degree program. In some ways, subjects are like 'folders' on your computer. So for this course, there's a top level subject of 'Introduction to Electronic Music', which is comprised of five smaller subject, "ItEM - Foundation", "ItEM - Creating Sound", "ItEM - Changing Sound" and so on. The five smaller subjects contain about 5-10 units each. Not every course would need to follow this guideline, but I'm putting it out there for demonstration purposes.

For each unit, I've created a single video and several multiple choice questions based on the contents of the video. Sagefy would support really just about any amount or kind of content you'd like to upload.

Each subject will require a description of the subject, and each unit will require a specific learning goal. The "Foundation"'s subject description is:

  A small taste of the basics of electronic music. These units serve as the basis for topics on creating and changing sound.

And then each unit has a specific learning goal. For example the goal for the "Sound Parameters" unit is:

  Describe the basic parameters of sound: amplitude, frequency, pitch, phase, and timbre.

Some of the units require knowledge from other units. For example, the "Sound Parameters" requires the "What is Electronic Music?" unit.

Here's a sample from my own planning document:


  Subject - Foundation

  A small taste of the basics of electronic music. These units serve as the basis for topics on creating and changing sound.

  ### 01 Electronic Music
  https://sagefy.org/units/bH8bQhEm0s1bnFiyrbIUochk

  Define electronic music and the subjects electronic music covers

  - Requires: None

  ### 02 Sound Parameters
  https://sagefy.org/units/iMrZb5NbqVTiTBP8QD8lr6SJ

  Describe the basic parameters of sound: amplitude, frequency, duration, phase, and timbre.

  - Requires: 01 Electronic Music

  ### 03 Human Hearing
  https://sagefy.org/units/PNmRDSiLwO9lFnCAKl5fUS2L

  Describe common properties of human hearing, as hearing pertains to electronic music. (Frequency, Amplitude, Spatialization, Hidden Fundamental...)

  - Requires: 02 Sound Parameters

2. Proposing your first unit

So to start you'll have to propose creating a unit for your course. The way to do this current is to go to the 'mother unit':
https://sagefy.org/units/1rk0jS5EGEavSG4NBxRvPkZf

![The mother unit - Sagefy](http://i.imgur.com/Sr584d0.png)

From here, click "Create a New Topic". Change the post kind to "proposal". Change the entity kind to "unit". Fill out the rest of the form, including the name of your course in the topic and proposal name. Make sure to include the unit goal. For now you can skip the 'unit requires'.

![Create a proposal](http://i.imgur.com/bH36ZLT.png)

Your unit will not be 'live' as soon as you click "Create Topic", but it will create the topic. You will need two approvals for the unit to be approved. For now, email <support@sagefy.org> and I will happily grant you two approvals.

Afterwards, continue to make each of your units. For the unit requires field, you will find the ID of the other units on the unit page.

I'll continue to work on this document in the coming days, and will include:

- Creating subjects
- Creating sub-subjects
- Creating cards
- Verifying your work
