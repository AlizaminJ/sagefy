Problem
* Learners waste time and effort on materials that don’t tightly fit their current level of knowledge.
* Learners have difficulty finding learning materials on more niche subjects they are interested in.
* A great deal of human knowledge is still locked up in pay-to-play systems.


Solution
* Provide an open-content, adaptive learning platform to everyone, for free.
* Open-content allows for mass creation of a wide variety of content.
* Adaptive learning tightly matches learner prior knowledge.
* The combination is more powerful than the individual parts.


Alternatives
* Classroom - Barely adaptive. Not open-content. Limited audience.
* Learning management systems - most traditional of edtech. Not open-content. Limited adaptive ability.
* Current adaptive learning systems - expert created content. Not generalizable.
* Massive open online courses - still expert created content. Not adaptive.
* Flash card systems - somewhat adaptive. Some open content. Limited options for types of content.
* Current open-content systems - non-adaptive. Have to create own learning path.


Key Metrics
* Number of learners in the system - growth, engagement, retention
* Amount of content created
* Quality of content created - how effective is the content at optimal time/effort given learner prior knowledge and goal
* $$$ - ability to get more donations than operating costs


Unique Value Proposition
* The combination of both adaptive learning and open-content, for free.
