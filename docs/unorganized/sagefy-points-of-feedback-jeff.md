Sagefy – Points of Feedback

Name
Makes sense, simple and easy to remember. Might need a tagline “Safegy is an open-content adaptive learning platform” is a mouthful, but it’s the core of what it’s doing
Open-content adaptive learning model
This seems to be its strength and weakness. I think young students & teachers would love to have this type of flexibility at their fingertips. I think something about how its the “codification” of the Eight Ideas, to say how it achieves adaptability.

- I can also see some “institutions” that wouldn’t appreciate the collaborative approach to content creation, and would also probably get hung up on the idea, that the content delivered to learners might be different - standardization is everything!
  The Ideas
  Damn - someone’s done a little reading.  
  1-7 are very clear, distinct concepts - 8 “Open Up” might overlap with 7 Collaborate - I think the goal is to put extra emhpasis on active -shared- learning
  There’s a bit of an implied, Do 1, then 2 to amplify 1, then 3 to amplify 2 & 1 … In some cases this really makes sense, but it might be worth thinking about the ideas like :
  Subject Goals -> Pick one Goal, Stay Organized around the one Goal -> Use Prior knowledge to understand the one Goal, Make the one Goal real, Go deep on the one…
  All in all, these sound like the core principles Mel (wife/special ed teacher) drills her charges with
  Data Structure
  Cards, Units and Subjects seem like logical groupings. It makes sense that a subject would be defined around a concept like “Addition of Fractions” with Units on LCD and Decimal conversion, with Cards that explain, and test individual concepts. Part of me thinks either a “Special” Card type or other Model for topic overview/help. It seems like some cards would want to have a “?” help topic linked, or a “review unit basics” in case a learner wanted to review some previously introduced concept
