title: Metrics
description: |
    Sagefy uses a larger-than-typical metric system. The rhythm is 26px both vertically and horizontally. The base font size is 18px with a line-height of 26px. Columns are 52px and gutters are 26px. Because of Sagefy's large metrics, a great deal of focus and minimalism is required.
