### Recent Changes

Because this is the first newsletter, I'm including some of the highlights of the past few months. Normally this newsletter will be pretty short.

- Entirely new content creation system, based on usability testing.
- Created a test "suggest" page: suggest new subjects and upvote too. http://sagefy.org/suggest
- Created repeatable process and faster, easier local dev with Docker Compose.
- Some API endpoints have been split for greater flexibility.
- Migrated from RethinkDB back to PostgresQL.
- Updated service test coverage to 96%.
- Building out a full sitemap for Google indexing.
- Font update from Georgia to Rubik. Come check it out!
- Lots of minor copy changes and bug fixes, styling consistency updates and usability improvements.
- Several new posts on Medium. http://stories.sagefy.org/

### 2017 Oct 16 - 2017 Oct 29

**Page Card Kind**: Sagefy always had video cards and choice cards. I've added the ability to create page cards. Page cards are written content. For now, formatting options include bold, italic, headings, and embedding images.

There is a new page card for each of the 29 units in the Electronic Music subject. The content is the same as the video for each unit, just in written form instead of video. Here is an example https://sagefy.org/cards/PC9ac99ZQqWR-ZiEyP0wgw

### Upcoming Two Weeks: 2017 Oct 30 - 2017 Nov 12

Beginning work on interactive examples -- using the Web Audio API -- of each of the 29 Electronic Music units. See the list at https://github.com/heiskr/sagefy-electronic-music

This will also be a new card kind, though I haven't picked a name yet.

### Upcoming major items in the backlog

- Completing interactive examples for Electronic Music subject.
- Updating the state management system for the client code.
- Rebuilding the suggest page based on feedback.
- Enable editing content from the web interface.

...and about 120 more tasks currently.
