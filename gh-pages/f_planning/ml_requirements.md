### Diagnosis

- Determine how much the learner knows about a unit.

### Assessment

- Determine how much the learner knows currently about a unit.
    - Use responses to assessments.
    - Consider difficulty of card based on other learners.
    - Make progress available to learner.
    - Determine how well the learner has retained the knowledge of the unit.

### Sequencing

- Determine the best order to present cards, units, and sets to the learner.
    - Order both non-assessment and assessment cards.
    - Order to include knowledge score as quickly as possible.
    - Order to optimize retention.
    - Prefer cards that match the learner's skill level.
    - Prefer cards that minimize route work and use Bloom's.
    - Prefer sequences that build metacognitive.
    - Find card pairs and other sequences that optimize learning.
    - Account for card prerequisites.
    - Alter cards based on size of group (single, two, three...)
    - Features: tags, kinds and formats, other learner performance, etc.
    - Deal with asynchronous assessment
    - Determine when the learner should take a break.
    - Determine when best to switch to a different unit.
    - Account for unit prerequisites.
    - Determine when a unit should be reviewed for optimal retention.
    - Draw a prerequisite tree of units.
    - Estimate durations for completion.

### Other Machine Learning Uses

- Assess the quality and validity of cards, units, and sets.
- Recommend new units to the learner.
- Filter spam and low quality content.
- Mark down low quality discussion.
- Matching up learners with other learners and mentors.
- Ensure no prerequisite cycles.
- High quality search through entities, discussions, messages...

### Known systems

- How much does the learner already know? _Knowledge Spaces_
- How well does the learner know the topic (currently)? _Bayesian Knowledge Tracing_
- How likely is the learner to answer correctly? _Item Response_
- When should we move on or review? _Spaced Learning_
