## Core Attributes

- Learner to Unit Efficacy
    - How well does the learner know the unit?
    - Measure: Bayesian Knowledge Tracing
- Card Difficulty
    - How likely is a learner to get the right (objective) or a good (subjective) answer?
    - Measure: ???
- Card Quality
    - How much is the card is likely to improve the learner's efficacy?
    - Measure: ???

## Composed Attributes

- Learner to Card Efficacy [Item Response] -- called `likelihood` below
    - How likely is the learner to answer well?
- Learner to Set Efficacy
    - How likely is the learner to know the set?
    - Composition of Learner to Unit Efficacy
- Unit Difficulty
    - How difficult is it for a typical learner to gain proficiency?
    - Translate to time
- Set Difficulty
    - Same as unit difficulty
- Unit Quality
    - ???
- Set Quality
    - ???

## Process

- Diagnosis
    - Starting at the end of the set,
      makes a guess about the learner's efficacy about each unit
    - Any unit with a low efficacy, then assess the prerequisite efficacy
- Primary
    - Low: Focus on high quality non-assessment cards,
        mixed in with high (60-80%) likelihood cards
    - Mid: Focus on middle likelihood (50%) cards of at least moderate quality.
        - If there is a decline in efficacy, intervene with a non-assessment card
    - High: Focus on mid-to-low likelihood (30-50%)
    - What levels are low, mid, and high? What confidence to assert?
- Review
    - Determine intervals (time) for review per unit.
    - More time will impact efficacy more greatly.
