Contributor Rating
------------------

We consider contributor rating based on **proposals** and **votes**.

- (0): I create a proposal
- (-): I create a proposal, and it's blocked
- (0): I create a proposal, and I decline it
- (+): I create a proposal, and it's accepted
- (0): I vote for a proposal
- (-): I vote for a proposal, and it's blocked
- (0): I vote for a proposal, but it's declined
- (+): I vote for a proposal, and it's accepted
- (0): I vote against a proposal, and it's blocked
- (+): I vote against a proposal, and it's declined by its creator

Proposal Friction
-----------------

Proposals that are more likely to impact learners directly should have more friction.

- Create set: low friction
- Create unit: low friction
- Create card: depends on unit's quality score
- Update/delete set: Quality score
- Update/delete unit: Quality score
- Update/delete card: Unit quality score, card quality score
