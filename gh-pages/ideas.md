title: The Ideas
---

The ideas are the foundation of Sagefy's architecture. The ideas are broad and based on highly common patterns in memory and learning research. Use the ideas to provide a sense of direction.

### 1) Do One Thing at a Time

Our memory system is powerful but limited. We are most effective when focusing on one task at a time. [More on 1.](/f_ideas/one_thing_at_a_time)

### 2) Keep Organized

Our memory system works by forming relationships. Mastery is the result of an organized thought process. [More on 2.](/f_ideas/keep_organized)

### 3) Use Prior Knowledge

The strongest predictor of how much we will learn is what we already know. Every learning experience must be adapted to the learner's prior knowledge. [More on 3.](/f_ideas/use_prior_knowledge)

### 4) Adhere to Goals

Defining small, achievable goals and constantly checking against them builds better, more focused content. [More on 4.](/f_ideas/adhere_to_goals)

### 5) Make it Real

We rely on real-life experiences to guide to our learning. [More on 5.](/f_ideas/make_it_real)

### 6) Go Deep

Route memorizing isn't enough. We must be able to use our knowledge. [More on 6.](/f_ideas/go_deep)

### 7) Work Together

We are more effective as team or as a community. Often, but not always. [More on 7.](/f_ideas/work_together)
