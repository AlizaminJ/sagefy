title: The Eight Ideas â€“ Use Prior Knowledge
---

_The strongest predictor of how much we will learn is what we already know. Every learning experience must be adapted to the learner's prior knowledge._

What do we mean by "Use Prior Knowledge"?
-------------------------------------

- Adjust the challenge level to the learner's knowledge.
- Ensure a learner knows what they need to in order to complete a task.
- Focus on areas of weakness.
- Focus on building knowledge.
- Connect new information with prior knowledge.

Why is prior knowledge so important?
--------------------------------------

_TODO_

How does Sagefy implement this idea?
------------------------------------

- Cards and units have prerequisites, which ensures the learner has sufficient prior knowledge.
- The algorithms which sequence show cards, units, and sets that are available to the learner.
    - The algorithms which sequence the entities focus on improving the learner's prior knowledge.
    - A diagnostic assessment means learners can build prior knowledge where lacking.
    - A learner with high prior knowledge can skip to more relevant areas.
