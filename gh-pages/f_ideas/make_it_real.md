title: The Ideas – Make it Real
---

_We rely on real-life experiences to guide to our learning._

What do we mean by "Make it Real"?
-------------------------------------

- Connect material with real life problems.
- Use images and videos to connect with the visual processing center.
- Present the problem first, and allow the learner to arrive at the solution.
- Avoid overly formal or showy presentation.

Why is making it real so important?

How does Sagefy implement this idea?
------------------------------------

- The flexibility of card formats allows using audio, images, and video.
- Cards can have prerequisites, allowing for more involved projects based on problem-based learning.
