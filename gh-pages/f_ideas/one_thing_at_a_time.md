title: The Eight Ideas â€“ Do One Thing at a Time
---

_Our memory system is powerful but limited. We are most effective when focusing on one task at a time._

What do we mean by "Do One Thing at a Time"?
-------------------------------------

- Only do one specific activity at any given point in time.
- Avoid multitasking.
- Prefer one source of input and one source of output at a time.
- Scaffold the learner to success.
- Avoid unnecessary choices.
- Stay focused and eliminate tangents.

Why is doing one thing at a time so important?

How does Sagefy implement this idea?
------------------------------------

- The user can only be presented one card at a time.
- The user only works on one unit at a time.
- When the learner must make a choice about which set or unit to pursue, the learner is only presented with the choice.
- A contributor can only change one entity at a time.
