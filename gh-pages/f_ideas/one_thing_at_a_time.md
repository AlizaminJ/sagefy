_Our memory system is powerful but limited. We are most effective when focusing on one task at a time._

What do we mean by "Do One Thing at a Time"?
-------------------------------------

- Only do one specific activity at any given point in time.
- Avoid multitasking.
- Prefer one source of input and one source of output at a time.
- Scaffold the learner to success.
- Avoid unnecessary choices.
- Stay focused and eliminate tangents.
