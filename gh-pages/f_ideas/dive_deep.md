title: The Ideas – Dive Deep
---

_Route memorizing isn't enough. We must be able to use our knowledge._

What do we mean by "Dive Deep"?
-------------------------------------

- Go beyond route memorization. Challenge the learner to explain, analyse, apply, and synthesize.
- Build metacognitive capabilities.
- Go in for the long term. Use spaced repetition.
- Focus on developing areas of weakness.
- Remove barriers to going deep.

How does Sagefy implement this idea?
------------------------------------

- Sets can contain sets and units. Sets can scale out extensively.
- Cards are flexible in format. This flexibility means we can ask for more than comprehesion.
- By removing complexity in the data structure, we make room for more depth by adding flexibility.
- The system encourages spaced repetition to ensure maximum retention of knowledge.
