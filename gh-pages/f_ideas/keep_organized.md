title: The Eight Ideas – Keep Organized
---

_Our memory system works by forming relationships. Mastery is the result of an organized thought process._

What do we mean by "Keep Organized"?
-------------------------------------

- Show how information is organized directly to the learner.
- Relate information to prior information.
- Task the learner with organizational challenges.
- Use technology to automate organization.

How does Sagefy implement this idea?
------------------------------------

- The three basic entities are easy to remember and have a clear hierarchy.
- Sets can embed each other, allowing for a variety of organizational structures.
- A card must belong to a unit, which defines its purpose.
- A unit can only have a single goal, limiting extraneous information.
- Prerequisites are available for cards and units, allowing for the system to automatically keep things organized with low effort.
- Contributors do not organize courses, but simply describe relationships. The algorithms handle keeping things organized to the learner.
