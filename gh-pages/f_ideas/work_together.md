_We are more effective as team or as a community. Often, but not always._

What do we mean by "Work Together"?
-------------------------------------

- Allow more experienced learners to pair up and group up.
- Invite discussion at all levels.
- Use consensus to build.
- Communicate and log.
- Return to the community.
- Be honest with learners.
- Hold users accountable.
- Don't cover up non-private information.

How does Sagefy implement this idea?
------------------------------------

- Learners can work on cards together.
- Discussions are available for all cards, units, and sets.
- Creating and editing content uses the consensus model.
- Everything is open source.
- Documentation throughout.
- Everything in the cards is public by default.
- Providing basic analytics to everyone means we can have more honest conversations.
- Everything is up for discussion and can be flagged.
- Sagefy is open source and is built on open source software.
