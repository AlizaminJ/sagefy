### What do we know about learner motivation?

- SH 200: Learner's beliefs about themselves will change their learning outcomes. If learners believe they are in control of their intelligence, self-efficacy, motivation, strategies, and behaviors, they are more likely to succeed.
    - Cites Schommer, 1994; Henderson & Dweck, 1990; Aronson, Fried, & Good, 2002
- SH 191: One of the greatest challenges of learning is managing one's own learning.
    - Cites Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005
- SH 192: Many models exist to describe metacognitive learning. All of which describe processes to monitor and control learning.
    - Cites Brown et al., 1983; Butler, 1997; Pintrich, 2000; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2001
- SB 338: Motivation is very important to learning outcomes.
    - Cites Means, Jonassen, & Dwyer, 1997
- SB 342: Learner place value into their goals, and can be grouped as attainment, intrinsic, or utility.
- SB 342-343: The belief that you can accomplish your goal and are in control of it will greatly improve learning outcomes.
    - Cites Robbins, Lauver, Le, Davis, Langley, & Carlstrom, 2004
- SB 343-344: The type of learner interest in the goal will impact how the learner approaches their goal.
    - Cites Eccles and Wigfield (2002); Hidi and Renninger (2006); Dickey (2005); Thiagarajan, 2006; Wacker & Silverman, 2003
- SB 348: Learner goals have a few dimensions: Challenge, Focus, Target, Achievement Orientation, & Drivers.
- SB 352-353: Intrinsic goals lead to better commitment to the goal.
    - Cites Greene & Azevedo, 2007; Vansteenkiste, Simons, Lens, Soenens, Matos, and Lacante (2004)

### Does asking learners their goals at the beginning of a course improve outcomes?

- SH 69: The three ways to understand and consider learner motivation is a) the value of the goal and b) their expectations of that goal and c) whether or not the environment is supportive.
    - Cites Atkinson, 1957, 1964; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992, 2000
- SH 71: Goals are the basis of "motivated behavior".
    - Cites Ryan, 1970; Mitchell, 1982; Elliot & Fryer, 2008
- SH 71: Often learners have performance goals to project their reputation. This can cause learners to to either seek high performance, or more often, avoid low performance.
    - Cites Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Elliot, 1999; Elliot & McGregor, 2001
- SH 72: Learners who focus on learning goals rather than performance goals have better outcomes.
    - Cites Barron & Harackiewicz, 2001; Harackiewicz, Barron, Taucer, Carter, & Elliot, 2000; Miller, Greene, Montalvo, Ravindran, & Nichols, 1996; Somuncuoglu & Yildirim, 1999; McGregor & Elliot, 2002
- SH 72: Some learners have a goal to minimize and avoid work.
    - Cites Meece & Holt, 1993
- SH 73: Learners with multiple goals do better than learners with one goal.
    - Cites Ford, 1992; Valle et al., 2003
- SH 74-75: The value of the goal can be a) attainment (accomplishment), b) intrinsic (internal, process), or c) extrinsic (praise, recognition, money).
    - Cites Wigfield and Eccles 1992, 2000
- SH 76: Learner goals change over the period of a course. Learners can transition from extrinsic and attainment goals to intrinsic goals.
    - Cites Hidi & Renninger, 2006

### How do we manage learner fatigue?

- SB 116: To sustain learner attention, manage their fatigue. Alter between types of activities and build in regular breaks.
- SB 119-120: Material pacing is critical to sustaining learner attention. A "relatively rapid pace" sustains attention.
    - Cites Anderson & Torrey, 1995 and Brophy and Good, 1986

### Does asking learners their satisfaction support learning?

- SE 317: Learner satistifaction has a low correlation with learning outcomes.
    - Cites Sitzmann, Brown, Casper, Ely, and Zimmerman (2008); Schnackenberg, Sullivan, Leader, and Jones (1998)
- SH 149: Let learners also see their areas of strength and improvement to support motivation; learners are often unaware of their own progress.

### How can the information be made relevant to the learner?

- SH 84: Identify your own values early in the course to encourage learners to understand those values and increase their motivation.
- SB 371: Add situational interest to support motivation.
    - Cites Means, Jonassen, and Dwyer (1997); Hidi and Renninger (2006); Means, Jonassen, and Dwyer,1997
- SB 370: To support motivation, present new ideas in familiar terms.
    - Cites Stepich & Newby, 1988
- SB 141: "Be sure there is a knowledge base in working memory for integrating new content by: (1) activating appropriate prior knowledge, (2) compensating for missing prior knowledge, and (3) mini- mizing the activation of irrelevant prior knowledge."
- SB 150-153: A pre-lesson case analysis ask learners to read about a cases before presenting new information. This can help to activate prior knowledge. Using multiple cases can show different perspectives.
    - Cites Bransford, Barron, Pea, Meltzoff, Kuhl, Bell, Stevens, Schwartz, Vye, Reeves, Roschelle, & Sabelli, 2006; Schwartz & Bransford, 1998
- SB 144-145: Asking and answering questions about relevant prior knowledge will activate it. You can also ask learners to form their own questions. Particularly, rendering the relationships between prior knowledge is effective (concept maps).
    - Cites Pressley, Wood, Woloshyn, Martin, King, & Menke, 1992; Gurlitt, Renkl, Motes, and Hauser 2006
- SB 158: If the learners already have the prior knowledge, activating it might not be necessary.
    - Clark, Nguyen, & Sweller, 2006

### Is setting learner expectations effective? What are the best strategies?

- SH 77: Learners must be able to expect a positive outcome from their learning.
    - Cites Carver & Scheier, 1998
- SH 213: Help learners to set realistic expectations of themselves to support motivation and metacognition.
