### Can humans learn effectively just by observing?

- SE 22: Cites three learning "architectures": receptive, directive, and guided discovery.
- SE 34: States that while each architecture is needed at different points in time, all three perspectives are required for expertise. (Hence, information, practice, integration, and application.)

### How important is practice to effective learning? How much practice is effective?

- SB 9: Expertise requires extensive practice, often more than 10 years. However, expertise training can be sped up using training simulation to less than 1/5 the time.
    - Cites Ericsson 2006 and Cites Gott & Lesgold 2000.

### How much repetition is necessary to remember a concept? For how long?

### When does practice stop being effective?

- SE 259: There is a power law to practice, the benefits diminish with more practice.
    - Cites Crossman, 1959; Rosenbaum, Carlson, & Gilmore, 2001
- SE 260-261: The amount of practice needs to reflect how critical the task is.
    - Cites Schnackenberg, Sullivan, Leader, & Jones, 1998; Schnackenberg & Sullivan, 2000

### How should practice be paced?

### What strategies are effective to promoting learner organization through practice?

### Is relevance important to effective practice? What strategies are effective?

- SH 84: Demonstrate the relevance of the material to the learner's current and future self.

### How can learners know what is most relevant in practice?

- SE 151-154: Keep to the learning objectives; do not add material that does not support learning objectives.
    - Cites Mayer and Moreno 2003; Garner, Gillingham, & White, 1989; Bishop, Amankwaita, and Cates (2008); Mayer & Johnson, 2010; Svetcov, 2000; Dewey 1913; Moreno and Mayer 2000a; Knez and Hygge 2002; Ransdell and Gilroy 2001; Mayer, 1993; Mayer, Sims, & Tajika, 1995; Dewey, 1913; Harp and Mayer 1998; Harp and Mayer 1998; Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Sanchez and Wiley 2006; Butcher 2006; Scheiter, Gerjets, Huk, Imhof, and Kammerer 2009; Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, and Campbell 2005
- SE 166-172: Do not add words to the lesson, either visually or graphically, that do not support learning objectives. An example is motivational stories.

### How does the challenge level impact learning?

### What is the best way to choose an appropriate challenge level?

- SB 350: Finding the right level of challenge for the learner's goal is critical to motivation.
    - Cites Locke and Lathamâ€™s (2002); (Malone & Lepper, 1987)

### What strategies can be used to keep learners engaged and motivated?

- SH 86: Give learners many opportunities, especially early on, for low-risk success.
- SH 86: Keep the level of challenge appriopriate to the learner to keep learners motivated. Preassessment can help identify the correct level of challenge.

### Is it effective to focus student attention? When is focusing student attention during practice effective?

- SB 118: Asking frequent questions can sustain learner attention and focus.
- SB 121-124: Cueing, or signaling, can help to focus learner attention on critical aspects. Examples are arrows, bolding text, emphasizing spoken words...

### Is it more effective to try to cover all material equally, or target areas of weakness during practice?

- SE 256: There are five major elements to deliberate practice:
    - a) Effort
    - b) Intrinsic motivation
    - c) Focus on areas of weakness
    - d) Explanatory feedback
    - e) Repetition
    - Cites Kellogg & Whiteford, 2009

    - Cites Ericsson 2006; Simon & Gilmartin, 1973
- SH 206: Give learners early assessments so they are more effectively able to evaluate their own strengths and weaknesses.

- SB 332-333: To support metacognitive developer, teach learners deliberate practice.
    - Cites Ericsson, 2006; Zimmerman (2006)

### What types of practice lead to far-transfer and expertise development?

- SB 11: Expertise requires highly deliberate practice, focusing on areas of weaknesses instead of pure repetition.
    - Cites Ericsson 2006.

### What strategies are effective for boosting student confidence?

### Is it better to practice an entire process at once, or step-by-step?

### Is scaffolding an effective strategy? When does it work?

- SH 105: Scaffolding, or letting learners focus on one task at a time before integrating skills, is highly effective. Worked examples are an example of scaffolding.
    - Cites Clarke, Ayres, and Sweller 2005, Sweller & Cooper, 1985; Cooper & Sweller, 1987; Paas & van Merrienboer, 1994

    - Cites Palincsar and Brown 1984
- SH 132-133: Scaffolds can be simple textual or diagram prompts; they do not necessarily need to be from a person directly.
    - Cites Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987
- SH 133: Scaffolding supports learner motiviation.
    - Cites Csikszentmihalyi, 1991

- SH 215: Scaffold learners in their metacognitive processes by starting with a ton of aids, and gradually weaning them off.

### When is automatic response needed? How do we train an automatic response?

### Should learners only be asked what they have been literally presented?

### Is it effective to attribute correct and incorrect answers to intelligence or effort?

### Is praise effective to learning outcomes?

### How can we promote knowledge transfer to real situations?

- SH 111: Focusing learner attention during study and application questions and projects can also help promote far-transfer.
    - Cites Gick & Holyoak, 1980; Perfetto et al., 1983; Klahr & Carver, 1988; Bassok, 1990
- SH 115-116: Scaffolding, or isolated practice, can help learners be more ready to transfer knowledge to other contexts.
- SB 257-258: Use learning aids, such as scaffolding or training wheels, to promote transfer without causing cognitive overload. Also try drilling on specific parts of the procedure before integrating them together.
    - Cites Carroll 1992
- SH 107: Asking learners to apply their knowledge promotes near- and far-transfer. Transfer, by human nature, is not automatic and less likely to work when the contexts vary more.

- SH 109: Learners are more capable of applying knowledge when they can "combine concrete experience within particular contexts and abstract knowledge that crosscuts contexts". Practicing knowledge in multiple contexts promotes application and far-transfer.
    - Cites Schwartz et al., 1999; Judd, 1908; Gick & Holyoak, 1983
- SB 263-265: To promote far transfer, practice in a variety of contexts.

    - Cites Atkinson, Renkl, and Merrill, 2003
- SE 269-271: Mix up practice questions, do not block practice. It will lead to lower immediate performance, but higher long term performance.
- SE 272: Keep practice questions in text for reference. Do not narrate practice questions, answers, responses, or feedback.
- SE 173: "Signaling includes using headings, bold, italics, underlining, capital letters, larger font, color, white space, arrows, and related techniques to draw the learnerâ€™s attention to specific parts of the display or page."

    - Cites Moreno and Mayer 2005, 2007

- SE 329: Use on screen navigational elements such as headers. Use links sparingly.
    - Cites Lorch, Lorch, Ritchey, McGovern, and Coleman (2001); Mayer (2005b); Neiderhauser, Reynolds, Salmen, and Skolmoski (2000); Shapiro (2008)
- SE 262-263: Practice should mirror the context to which it is applied.
- SE 272-273: Keep practice question content grouped logically and conveniently on the page.
    - Cites Rey (2011)
- SH 106: Not all reductions to cognitive load promote learning; learners need to fully use their cognitive capacity on the task at hand rather than being distracted.
    - Cites Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003, 2004
- SH 107: Learners often fail to apply knowledge to contexts due to context dependence of their knowledge.
    - Cites Mason Spencer & Weisberg, 1986; Perfetto, Bransford, & Franks, 1983
- SH 147: Set expectations for how much practice is necessary to achieve the goal.

    - Cites Healy, Clawson, & McNamara, 1993; Martin, Klein, & Sullivan, 2007

    - Cites De Bruin, Rikers, and Schmidt 2007
- SB 351-352: Focusing on mastery rather than performance leads to better learning strategies.
    - Cites Schunk and Zimmerman (2006)
- SB 360: To support self-confidence, provide tasks at the right challenge.
