### What is learning?

- SE 32: Defines learning as "a change in the learner's knowledge due to experience", defines instruction as  "manipulation of the learner's experiences to foster learning".
- SH 3: Learning is a process that leads to change, a result of experience. Learning is not done to students, but something students to do themselves.
    - Cites Mayer 2002

### Is learning in person or online more effective?

- SE 12-15: Despite decades promises of improvements over classroom teaching, and decades of resistance to new media, learning outcomes are roughly the same regardless of the medium. Instructional strategies are far greater predictors of learning outcomes.
    - Cites Hall and Cushing 1947, Clark 1994, Dillon & Gabbard 1998, Bernard et al. 2004, Tallent-Runnels, Thomas, Lan, Cooper, Ahern, Shaw and Liu 2006.
- SB 18: There  are no significant differences between learning based on format.
    - Cites Hall & Cushing, 1947, Bernard, Abrami, Lou, Borokhovski, Wade, Wozney, Wallet, Fishet, & Huang 2004, Tallent-Runnels, Thomas, Lan, Cooper, Ahren, Shaw, and Liu 2006.

### What teaching strategies exist? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

- SB 21-23: Describes three views of learning: 1) absorptive, 2) behavioral, and 3) constructive. Most courses orient towards the absorptive view due to constraints and ease of development. Constructive-based courses are the least common. The three views support four "architectures": receptive, directive, guided discovery, and exploratory.
    - Cites Mayer 2001

### Do learning styles greatly impact learning outcomes?

- Learning styles is a theory that breaks up learners by format, such as visual, auditory, and kinetic.
- According to [The Myth of Learning Styles](http://elearningindustry.com/the-myth-of-learning-styles), learning styles are not a strong predictor of learning outcomes.
- SE 15-16: Learning styles do not significantly impact learning outcomes.
    - Clark 2012, Pashler, Bain, Bottage, Graesser, Koedinger, McDaniel and Metclafe 2007.
- SE 137: Learning styles have no evidence to support altering instructional formats despite their popularity.
    - Cites Pashler, McDaniel, Rohrer, and Bjork (2008)

### Are learning guidelines absolute?

- SB 35-40, 45: Instructional design techniques are often bound by context; there are few absolute rules. Some of the most important factors that vary the context include a) learner prior knowledge, b) learner motivation, c) the goal of transfer (near/far), and  d) the types of tasks involved. Often, one experiment will not provide enough data, requires a meta analysis of multiple experiments to find these contextual factors.
