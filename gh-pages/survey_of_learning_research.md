_TODO: Establish core principles, and expand on them in sections._

This guide is intended as a reference of learning science research as relevant to Sagefy. It does not serve as a guide to learning instructional design. It does not answer every possible question or aspect.

Contributions are welcome! Please make a pull request to our [Github repository](http://github.com/heiskr/sagefy) or report on the [issues tab](https://github.com/heiskr/sagefy/issues).
