### How does memory work?

- SB 50-52: There are essentially two major types of memory: working (short-term), and long-term. Working memory focuses on the task at hand, and is limited by a small number of items. Because working memory is limited, there is a requirement for a great deal of focus and removing cognitive load for effective learning.
- SB 52-53: What's stored in long-term memory will greatly impact the amount of information that can reside in working memory at one time. There are two major types of long-term memories: declarative (factual) and procedural (how). The ways these types of memories are connected, or schemas, have a profound impact on being able to use in working memory. Transfer from working memory to long-term memory is the goal of transfer, and several strategies exist to promote transfer.
- SB 68: Working memory serves to 1) defining goals, 2) planning, and 3) monitoring.
- SB 69-70: Working memory stores information very temporarily. More than 50% is lost in 3 second of alternative activity.
    - Cites Peterson & Peterson, 1959
- SB 71-72: Experts have developed schemas in long-term memory, and therefore are able to process more information in their (same) working memory.
    - Cites Chase and Simon, 1973; Miller, 1956; Simon & Gilmartin, 1973
- SB 74: Seven +- two from the Miller study has since been corrected, more so to two to four elements.
    - Cites Miller, 1956 and Sweller, 2005
- SB 85: "Instructional designs that ignore working memory limitations are likely to be random in their effectiveness." - John Sweller, "Implications of Cognitive Load Theory,‚Äù 2005
- SB 165: Mental models, or schemas, are long-term memories that serve as the root of all expertise.
- SB 167: Mental models are built by integrating new information in working memory into existing knowledge in long-term memory.

### What is cognitive load? How do we manage it?

- SB 86-87: The four factors that determine cognitive load are a) complexity, b) prior knowledge, c) presentation rate and control, and d) instructional modes and methods.
- SB 112: "Manage attention in the design of instructional environments in ways that (1) optimize attention capacity, (2) direct attention to important instructional content, and (3) minimize divided attention in order to devote limited cognitive resources to learning."
- SB 115: "Attention during learning is influenced by (1) layout and features of the instructional materials and learning environment, (2) learner background knowledge, goals, and metacognitive skills, and (3) assignments during learning, such as questions."
- SB 116: To support learner focus and attention, manage the environment. Good lighting and snacks help!
- SB 120: Humans are excellent at filtering out distractions if we know where to focus.
    - Cites Cherry, 1953
- SB 130: Removing divided attention relies on three factors: a) inputs and outputs, b) difficulty of task, c) prior experience.
    - Cites Spelke, 1976
- SB 135: Keep all the instructions in one medium (computer, paper, etc).
    - Cites Cerpa, Chandler, and Sweller (1996)
- SH 103: Humans can't multitask, the performance degrades when a learner is asked to do more than one thing at a time. Experts at skills are more likely to be able to perform multiple tasks at a time.
    - Cites Kahnemann, 1973; Navon & Gopher, 1979; Wickens, 1991; Strayer and Johnston 2001; Smith & Chamberlin, 1992; Lansdown, 2002; Beilock, Wierenga, & Carr, 2002

### How much information can one person process at a time? What strategies are effective to managing cognitive load?

- SB 79-80  Working memory has both visual and auditory components as well as an executive component. Elderly and disabled people are less able to use both at the same time.
    - Cites Baddeley & Logie, 1999
- SB 75-77: When working memory is overloaded, the rate of processing new information declines dramatically.
    - Cites Hamilton and others 1977
- SB 89-90: Aids, or small notes or reference cards, can help to manage cognitive load.
- SB 92: Embed instructional aids and reference into the user interface early on.
- SB 94: To manage cognitive load, minimize the content. Write concisely. Omit details.
    - Cites Mayer, Bove, Bryman, Mars, and Tapangco (1996); Clark and Mayer, 2008; Mayer and Jackson (2005)
- SB 95-96: To reduce cognitive load, remove sound effects and all background music.
    - Cites Moreno & Mayer, 2000; Gibbons, 2007; Kenz and Hugge (2002); Gilroy (2001)
- SB 97-98: To reduce cognitive load, do not duplicate content between modes (audio and visual). Either have text or narration, not both.
    - Cites Clark & Mayer, 2008
- SB 100-101: To reduce cognitive load, start the lesson by teaching concepts first,  then start doing practice exercises.
    - Cites Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzell (2002)
- SH 106: Not all reductions to cognitive load promote learning; learners need to fully use their cognitive capacity on the task at hand rather than being distracted.
    - Cites Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003, 2004

### Is it more effective to add interesting information, or stick to the basics? Do emotional appeals help or hinder learning?

- SH 85: Show passion and enthusiasm for the subject, which will make the students more curious about the subject.
- SB 97: To reduce cognitive load, remove seductive details and tangential stories.
    - Cites Mayer (2005)
- SB 366: Avoid creating emotional interest; instead focus on building situational interest. Use simple, minimal content; use vivid language and examples; and make things human and personal.
    - Cites Sadoski, Goetz, & Fritz, 1993; Strun and White 2000; Moreno and Mayer (2000b); Clark and Mayer (2008)
- SB 345: Highly emotional appeals tend to not motivate learners, or can distract them.
    - Cites Clark & Mayer, 2008; Sadoski, Goetz, & Rodriguez, 2000; Schraw & Lehman, 2001
- SE 151-154: Keep to the learning objectives; do not add material that does not support learning objectives.
    - Cites Mayer and Moreno 2003; Garner, Gillingham, & White, 1989; Bishop, Amankwaita, and Cates (2008); Mayer & Johnson, 2010; Svetcov, 2000; Dewey 1913; Moreno and Mayer 2000a; Knez and Hygge 2002; Ransdell and Gilroy 2001; Mayer, 1993; Mayer, Sims, & Tajika, 1995; Dewey, 1913; Harp and Mayer 1998; Harp and Mayer 1998; Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Sanchez and Wiley 2006; Butcher 2006; Scheiter, Gerjets, Huk, Imhof, and Kammerer 2009; Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, and Campbell 2005
- SE 159-164: Do not add graphics that do not support the learning objectives. They can distract, disrupt, and seduce the learner and add cognitive load.
    - Cites Mayer, 1993; Mayer, Sims, & Tajika, 1995; Dewey, 1913; Harp and Mayer 1998; Harp and Mayer 1998; Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Sanchez and Wiley 2006
- SE 166-172: Do not add words to the lesson, either visually or graphically, that do not support learning objectives. An example is motivational stories.
    - Cites Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Lehman, Schraw, McCrudden, and Hartley 2007; Mayer, Griffith, Jurkowitz, and Rothman, 2008; Mayer, Bove, Bryman, Mars, & Tapangco, 1996; Mayer, 2001a; Mayer, Deleeuw, and Ayres 2007; Mayer and Jackson 2005
- SE 141-144: Some situations call for on screen text even when there is audio.
    - a) If there is nothing visual to display.
    - b) If the pacing is very slow
    - c) Non-native speakers
    - d) Learning disabilities
    - e) New keywords
    - f) Signaling the learner's attention
    - Cites Mayer, 2005b, 2009

### How can we reduce cognitive load in learning projects?

- SE 99: Keep the directions and the exercise together. Do not separate them into two different screens.
