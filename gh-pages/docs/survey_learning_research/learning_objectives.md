### What types of learning objectives are effective?

- SH 244-245: Learning objectives should be 1) framed from the student's perspective, 2) be broken down into smaller tasks based on specific cognitive processes, 3) use verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy, and 4) be measurable.
    - References Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001
- SE 20-21: Indicates three types of learning objectives: 1) inform, 2) perform a procedure (near-transfer) and 3) perform strategic tasks (far transfer).
- SH 244: Learning objectives > Read Miller, 1987 and Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001
- SB 351: Very specific goals are more likely to be met.
    - Cites Zimmerman, 2006; Grudowski, p. 73

### Does organizing a course around learning objective aid in learning?

- SB Ch6: Probably, yes. Learners have limited working memories. Extraneous information can hinder learning. Learning objectives tell both the contributor and learner what should receive focus, and what can be removed.
- SH 85: Learning objectives can help align instruction and assessment.
- SH 244: Highlights the benefits of course organization, cites Miller, 1987.
- SE 151-154: Keep to the learning objectives; do not add material that does not support learning objectives.
    - Cites Mayer and Moreno 2003; Garner, Gillingham, & White, 1989; Bishop, Amankwaita, and Cates (2008); Mayer & Johnson, 2010; Svetcov, 2000; Dewey 1913; Moreno and Mayer 2000a; Knez and Hygge 2002; Ransdell and Gilroy 2001; Mayer, 1993; Mayer, Sims, & Tajika, 1995; Dewey, 1913; Harp and Mayer 1998; Harp and Mayer 1998; Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Sanchez and Wiley 2006; Butcher 2006; Scheiter, Gerjets, Huk, Imhof, and Kammerer 2009; Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, and Campbell 2005
- SE 166-172: Do not add words to the lesson, either visually or graphically, that do not support learning objectives. An example is motivational stories.
    - Cites Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Lehman, Schraw, McCrudden, and Hartley 2007; Mayer, Griffith, Jurkowitz, and Rothman, 2008; Mayer, Bove, Bryman, Mars, & Tapangco, 1996; Mayer, 2001a; Mayer, Deleeuw, and Ayres 2007; Mayer and Jackson 2005

### Is presenting learning objectives effective? What method is most effective?

- SB 128-129: Presenting learning objectives help learners to focus on and pay more attention to goal-specific information, and lead to better attention during study and better assessment scores.
    - Cites Rothkopf & Billington, 1979 and Cavalier & Klein, 1998
- SB 364: Presenting learning objectives can allow learners to measure themselves to the objective instead of other learners.
- SH 204: Presenting learning objectives is necessary as learners may have their own set of expectations to compete with.
- SH 85: Use the learning objectives to align assessments and instruction, and clearly indiciating these objectives throughout will increase student motivation.

### Does presenting learning objectives promote learning of organization?

- SB 239: Learning objectives could be considered a form of pre-training. Pre-training exercises can promote organizational knowledge.
    - Cites Hilbert, Renkl, Kessler, and Reiss (2008) and Renkl, Hilbert, and Schworm (2009)
- SH 48: Organization structures are not so much right or wrong, but appropriate to different contexts.
    - Cites Eylon and Reif 1984
- SH 53: Providing learners with organizational structures can greatly improve learning outcomes. Giving learners "advance organizers" can supercharge their knowledge structure.
    - Cites Bower et al., 1969; Ausubel, 1960, 1978; Ausubel & Fitzgerald, 1962; Alexander, Frankiewicz, & Williams, 1979; Dean & Enemoh, 1983
- SH 145: Making goals explicit can help support deliberate practice via targeted feedback.

### When and how should learning objectives be available to the learner?

- SE 143: Learning objectives should be presented as text at the beginning of the lesson. Clark's redundancy principle suggest, because learning objectives don't have graphics, they don't need to be presented in audio.
- SB 128-129: Include the learning objectives to help learners focus their attention. Reiterate the learning objectives in information, practice, and assignments.
    - Cites Rothkopf & Billington, 1979; Cavalier & Klein, 1998
- SB 326: Include how to study the content in the learning object; and include forced monitoring of progress in the course.

### How many learning objectives should a component contain?
