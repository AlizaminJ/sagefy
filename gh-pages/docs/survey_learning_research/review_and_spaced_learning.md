### Is it better to review in a randomized order, or to segment the review topically?

- SH 31: Beginning lessons with activation of prior knowledge, and explicitly linking old information to new information, can greatly improve a learner's ability to integration new information.

### Is spaced learning effective?

- SB 101-102: To reduce cognitive load, segment lessons into short chunks; and let learners be in control of the pace of the segments.
    - Cites Mayer and Chandler (2001)
- SE 267-269: Distribute practice across the learning object to improve long-term retention.
    - Cites Ebbinghaus in 1913; Druckman and Bjork (1991); Bahrick, 1987; Seabrook, Brown, and Solity (2005); Rawson and Kintsch (2005); Rohrer and Taylor (2006)
- SB 213: Spaced practice takes less time and helps promote long term retention, up to years at a time. Spread out practice over time rather than keeping it all together.
    - Cites National Research Council, 1991; Rohrer and Taylor 2006; Bahrick, 1987

### How and when is spaced learning effective?

- SB 116: To sustain learner attention, manage their fatigue. Alter between types of activities and build in regular breaks.
    - See Taylor and Rohrer (2010)
- SE 261-262: Overlearning has little performance benefit and little impact on retention.
    - Cites Rohrer and Taylor 2006
- SH 146: Find opportunities to build more, and smaller scale, practice into the course.\
