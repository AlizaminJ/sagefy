### How do patterns of error impact course design?

- SH 31: Looking for patterns of errors in what student's do can help to identify inappropriate and inaccurate prior knowledge.
- SE 188: People interact with computers as if they are human. Human voices do better than machine voices.
    - Cites Reeves and Nass 1996; Mayer, Sobko, and Mautone 2003; Atkinson, Mayer, and Merrill 2005; Nass and Brave 2005

### What types of feedback are most effective during practice? What feedback is not effective?

- SH 58: Asking learners to explain correct answers can speed up the development of their knowledge organization.
    - Chi et al., 1989
- SE 97-98: Keep feedback together with both the question and the responses. Explain the correct answer rather than simply stating which answer is correct.
- SH 128: Targeted feedback helps learners to focus and greatly improves learning outcomes.
    - Cites Rothkopf and Billington 1979
- SH 128-129: Experts often do not make their feedback clear enough to learners, which interferes with deliberate practice. Tying the feedback to the learning objective can clarify the goal.
- SE 263-265: Provide explanatory feedback during practice.
    - Cites Hattie (2009); Kluger & DeNisi, 1996; Shute, 2008; Moreno (2004); Moreno and Mayer (2005)
- SE 267: Add feedback that demonstrates progress over time.
- SE 267: The feedback should be on the same view as the question, the answers, and the response.
- SE 267: Include an explanation of the correct answer in feedback.
- SB 361-362: To support self-confidence, build guidance and feedback into practice
    - Cites Moreno 2004
- SH 126-127: Practice and feedback are an endless loop towards a goal, and both are equally critical to developing skills.
- SH 130: Target feedback only works when the level of challenge is in the right balance for the learner.
    - Cites Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Romer, 2003
- SH 137-138: Targeted and goal-directed feedback provides learners with a map.
- SH 139-140: Feedback is more effective when it is specific rather than general.
    - Cites Black & William, 1998; Cardelle & Corno, 1981; Balzer et al., 1989; McKendree, 1990
- SH 145: Making goals explicit can help support deliberate practice via targeted feedback.
- SH 151: Use peer feedback with very explicit guidelines and criteria.
- SH 151: Require learners to use their prior feedback and explain how they used it in future work.
- SB 214-215: Use explanatory feedback to help support building correct mental models.
    - Cites Moreno 2004
- SB 215-217: Support intrinsic (question specific) feedback with instructional feedback (why the outcome occurred).
- SH 180: Support uncertainy and ambiguity. Resist a single fact or correct answer.

### How much feedback is effective? How much feedback is too much?

- SH 140-141: Too much feedback can impose cognitive overload and hinder learning.
    - Cites Lamburg, 1980; Shuman, 1979
- SH 149: Prioritize feedback to not overwhelm learners.

### Do students need positive reinforcement in feedback on errors?

- SH 88: Explain to learners in the feedback how their success and failure is in their control, and can be accomplished by effective studying to accomplish the goal. Explain that the results are not a result of personal characteristics.
- SH 77: Learners must believe they are capable of achieving their goals.
    - Cites Bandura, 1997
- SE 267: Do not provide feedback that compares learners with other learners.
- SH 78: The way students look at their successes and failure, also known as attributions, will greatly alter their motivations. If a learner believes success and failure are something they control, they will be more motivated. If they believe their reason for success and failure is external, they will lose motiviation.
    - Cites Weiner, 1986
- SB 364-365: To support mastery-based goals, encourage learners to attribute success and failure to things within their control.
- SE 266: Focus learner attention to the task rather than themselves. “Praise usually contains little task-related information and is rarely converted into more engagement, commitment to the learning goals, enhanced self-efficacy, or understanding about the task”
    - Cites Hattie and Gan (2011), Shute (1998), and Kluger and DeNisi (1996); Hattie and Gan (2011)
- SH 212: Directly intervene on student's beliefs about their own learning to support the idea that they are in control of their learning.

### When is feedback most effective?

- SH 87: Targeted and timely feedback will help motivate learners for future action.
- SE 267: The feedback should be on the same view as the question, the answers, and the response.
- SE 97-98: Keep feedback together with both the question and the responses. Explain the correct answer rather than simply stating which answer is correct.
- SH 142 The most effective feedback tends to happen immediately; frequency is not as important as timeliness.
    - Cites Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Traxler & Gernsbacher, 1992; Mathan & Koedinger, 2005
- SH 150: Design for frequent feedback opportunities.

### Is peer feedback effective? When and what situations?

- _Needs research_

### How many attempts should learners be given?

- _Needs research_

### Is asking learner to explain their reasoning for their answers effective? Is it more effective to ask learners to explain the correct answer? Are learner predictions effective?

- SH 19: Learners often perform procedures without understanding the ideas behind them.
    - Cites Berry & Broadbent, 1988; Reber & Kotovsky, 1997; Sun, Merrill, & Peterson, 2001
- SH 151: Require learners to use their prior feedback and explain how they used it in future work.
- SH 33: Asking a learner to predict the outcome of a new context based on their existing prior knowledge can improve recall of the new information.
- SH 44: Getting the right answer is often not as critical as using existing knowledge to organize and predict answers. Beginners often focus on the right answer over the reasoned answer; experts are the opposite.
- SB 365: To support mastery-based goals, assess both process and outcomes.

### Is peer review effective? When and how?

- SH 142 The most effective feedback tends to happen immediately; frequency is not as important as timeliness.

- SH 150: Design for frequent feedback opportunities.
- SB 214-215: Use explanatory feedback to help support building correct mental models.
    - Cites Moreno 2004
- SH 151: Use peer feedback with very explicit guidelines and criteria.

### Is it effective to ask learners to evaluate their own work against the work of others?

- SH 209-210: Have learners evaluate peer work to support their own metacognitive development. Ensure there is specific criteria for evaluation.

### What is the best method to set performance expectations?

- SH 129-130: Teachers can help target feedback more clearly by using a rubric, which supports deliberate practice.
    - Cites Goodrich Andrade 2001; Nelson 1990
- SH 205: Include performance criteria with assignments to support metacognitive development.

### How can rubrics be used effectively? Where is evidence effective?

- SH 87: Providing rubrics can help learners plan the task and set positive expectations of their own performance, motivating them to complete the task.
- SE 97-98: Keep feedback together with both the question and the responses. Explain the correct answer rather than simply stating which answer is correct.
- SH 128: Targeted feedback helps learners to focus and greatly improves learning outcomes.
    - Cites Rothkopf and Billington 1979

- SH 137-138: Targeted and goal-directed feedback provides learners with a map.
- SH 140-141: Too much feedback can impose cognitive overload and hinder learning.
    - Cites Lamburg, 1980; Shuman, 1979
- SH 145: Making goals explicit can help support deliberate practice via targeted feedback.
- SH 149: Prioritize feedback to not overwhelm learners.
- SB 215-217: Support intrinsic (question specific) feedback with instructional feedback (why the outcome occurred).

- SH 147: When there is a pattern of misinterpretation of the goals, explicitly show what you do not want.
- SH 204: Be very explicit with assignments including the goals of the assignment.

### Can heuristics be effective? Can self-assessment with heuristics be effective?

- SH 151: Require learners to use their prior feedback and explain how they used it in future work.
