# Sagefy

**Sagefy is an open-content adaptive learning platform.**

Sagefy is an _adaptive learning system_. It does not have planned and structured courses. Instead, Sagefy organizes tiny bits of information and practice by _learning objectives_. Learning objectives are then grouped in sets. _Adaptive learning algorithms_ decide optimal ordering. The algorithms ensure the content matches the learner's skill level and goals. Sagefy uses learning science research in determining its [structure](https://docs.sagefy.org/data_structure) and [objectives](https://docs.sagefy.org/ideas).

Sagefy is _open-content_. Anyone can contribute. A _consensus decision-making process_ determines the content. Learners, teachers, and anyone in the world can create and edit content. Open-content, consensus-based models succeed in generating large volumes of high quality content.

Sagefy is open-source. The content and the code are freely available.
