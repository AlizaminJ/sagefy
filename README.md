# Sagefy

_Sagefy is an open-content adaptive learning platform._

**Sagefy is an adaptive learning system.** Instead of having predetermined structured courses, bits of information and practice are organized by _learning objectives_. Learning objectives are then grouped in sets. This flexible [data structure](https://docs.sagefy.org/data_structure) allows for creating very small entities of learning and stitching them together. _Adaptive learning algorithms_ decide optimal ordering, ensuring the content matches the learner's skill level and goals. Sagefy uses [learning science research](https://docs.sagefy.org/ideas) in determining its structure and objectives.

Sagefy is open-content; **anyone can contribute**. All content is made freely available to everyone. Content is determined by a _consensus decision-making process_. Content can be created and edited by learners (students), contributors (teachers), and anyone in the world. Open-content, consensus-based models succeed in generating large volumes of high quality content.

Sagefy is also open-source. The content and the code are freely available.
