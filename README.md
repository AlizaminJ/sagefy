# Sagefy

**Sagefy is an open-content adaptive learning platform.**

Sagefy is an _adaptive learning system_. Instead of planned and structured courses, small objects of learning content are joined through relationships. Adaptive learning algorithms decide optimal ordering. Sagefy optimizes for learner knowledge and goals. No more learning things you already know. No more learning things you arenâ€™t ready for. Sagefy stays focused on what you want to learn.

Open-content systems allow anyone to view, share, create, and edit content. Like most open-content systems, Sagefy works through consensus-driven decision making. Sagefy is open source and freely available.

Sagefy uses learning science research in its [structure](https://github.com/heiskr/sagefy/wiki/Data-Structure) and [ideas](https://github.com/heiskr/sagefy/wiki/Ideas).
